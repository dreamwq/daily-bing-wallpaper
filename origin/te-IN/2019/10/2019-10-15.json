The forest canopy is aflame with autumn colour, and here, the highbush blueberries on the forest floor provide an additional splash of colour. Acadia has six marked coastal trails, and our photo today was taken on one of the most popular: Wonderland Trail. It’s just 2.2 kilometre round-trip, an easy trek for families and casual hikers. Acadia is Maine’s only national park, and it’s easy to see why this landscape was preserved—look at that beautiful fall colour, and that’s just at ground level.","date":"Oct 16, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191015_AcadiaBlueberries%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5cca01b382b323e7a0cbd84a48481b10","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AcadiaBlueberries_EN-IN9912863393_tmb.jpg","title":"Acadia transformed","desc":"Historically, mid-October is peak fall foliage season in Acadia National Park in Maine state, northeastern United States.
