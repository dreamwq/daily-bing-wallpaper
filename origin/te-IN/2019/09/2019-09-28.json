While winemaking techniques have evolved and improved over the thousands of years that wine has been made here, each year around this time locals and visitors gather in the region's capital of Logroño to celebrate the wine harvest and see a traditional example of the first, uh, step of this process—crushing newly harvested grapes by stomping them with bare feet.","date":"Sep 29, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190928_ClavijoLandscape%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9ae903834f05e481537fc9471787db7b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ClavijoLandscape_EN-IN6110153009_tmb.jpg","title":"Falling for Rioja","desc":"While today's image of beautiful fall colours in Rioja is serene and peaceful, the people of this area are hard at work harvesting grapes at…","hash":"U6rYHYAxpPDGbSmnuVQV3O7RYkT0cK5xMyxtmJYz+RY="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"లోడ్ చేస్తోంది...","previous":"మునుపటి చిత్రం","next":"తదుపరి చిత్రం","walle":"ఈ చిత్రం వాల్‌పేపర్‌గా డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయడానికి అందుబాటులో లేదు.","walls":"ఈ చిత్రాన్ని డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయండి. ఈ చిత్రం వినియోగం వాల్‌పేపర్‌కి మాత్రమే పరిమితం చేయబడింది."}}
