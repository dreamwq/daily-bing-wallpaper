The unusual architecture of this masjid embraces both Hindu and Islamic styling. It is believed that the artisans who worked on the interiors imbibed these styles, reminiscent from their forefathers who might have worked on temples in the past. Look closely, and one can observe symbols of lotus insignia, pots and vines, sun and diamonds, which all signify the sectarian attitude of the artisans, who worked not just on masjids, but also Hindu and Jain temples.  Today, on the occasion of Miladun-nabi (the Prophet Mohammed’s birth anniversary), you can expect the Champaner Jama Masjid, among others in the country to be frequented by more than the average number of visitors.","date":"Nov 10, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191109_ChampanerMasjid%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"84b95da2e392422bede6bae7f31eb247","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChampanerMasjid_EN-IN8184541844_tmb.jpg","title":"A blend of styles at Champaner","desc":"You are looking at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Champaner Jama Masjid, Gujarat, on today’s homepage.
