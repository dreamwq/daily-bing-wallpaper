But each fall, millions of these orange and black beauties embark upon one of the world's most amazing migrations. The insects make use of air currents to make the long journey south to the mountains of southwestern Mexico, a flight of up to 5,000 kilometres. Aside from being a staggeringly great distance for these delicate insects to fly, it's also a journey to a place that not one of them has ever been to before. And unlike the many bird species that undertake annual roundtrip migrations, these butterflies will never return to the north. Why not? Because the distance and length of the total annual migration cycle is greater than the lifespan of individual monarchs.","date":"Nov 25, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191124_OverwinteringMonarchs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c2aca059a4ebe521e4f6cd4cd1ab4e6d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OverwinteringMonarchs_EN-IN8528235876_tmb.jpg","title":"The migrating monarchs of Michoacan","desc":"Probably the most recognisable of all the butterfly species, monarchs are helpful pollinators that can be found across the United States and…","hash":"x9+wQB1Foo6JRekcbvULAIUE9w6GwiCPDeSSl0mxSes="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"లోడ్ చేస్తోంది...","previous":"మునుపటి చిత్రం","next":"తదుపరి చిత్రం","walle":"ఈ చిత్రం వాల్‌పేపర్‌గా డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయడానికి అందుబాటులో లేదు.","walls":"ఈ చిత్రాన్ని డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయండి. ఈ చిత్రం వినియోగం వాల్‌పేపర్‌కి మాత్రమే పరిమితం చేయబడింది."}}
