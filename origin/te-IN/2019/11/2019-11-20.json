The freshest you've got—this year! No more of this old stuff.' Hollywood star Steve Martin was joking when his character in 'The Jerk' (1979) asked for fresh wine—or perhaps he was talking about Beaujolais nouveau. The red wine, produced in the Beaujolais region of France, is fermented for just a few weeks and requires no barrel ageing before it's sold starting on the third Thursday of November. Beaujolais nouveau is a light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. Located south of Burgundy, the Beaujolais region has a relatively warm climate, so Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and other famous French grapes don't grow well there. But the fruity Gamay grows vigorously in Beaujolais and is used to make Beaujolais nouveau.","date":"Nov 21, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191120_BeaujolaisRegion%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ee4440972f1b0740530232f92b9d3165","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeaujolaisRegion_EN-IN0286594716_tmb.jpg","title":"The new Beaujolais has arrived!","desc":"'Bring us some fresh wine!
