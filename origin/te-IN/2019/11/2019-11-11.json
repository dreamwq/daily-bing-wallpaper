They are also referred to as the ‘Akali’ – the immortals.  On the occasions of Sikh festivals, processions of Nihangs can be seen performing the Gatka. It is a sword dance (today performed with sticks more commonly than swords), that took shape as a result of the fusion of ancient Indian martial arts with sword practice sessions with the British Indian Army in the 19th century.  The style was divided into 2 categories of rasmi (ritualistic) and khel (sport) in the 1880s. Gatka is now considered both a sword dance, and a sport.","date":"Nov 12, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191111_Nihang%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"0df4af5ea4a42d40b5df39749ebbea3b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Nihang_EN-IN9356950084_tmb.jpg","title":"Nihangs performing the Gatka","desc":"Today on Guru Nanak Jayanthi, we bring to you the Nihang, a Sikh warrior sect, known for their numerous victories throughout history…","hash":"Mg+KdoLBjuPQCefk95F6ptXEJcRYoxgfVBSa519PcXE="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"లోడ్ చేస్తోంది...","previous":"మునుపటి చిత్రం","next":"తదుపరి చిత్రం","walle":"ఈ చిత్రం వాల్‌పేపర్‌గా డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయడానికి అందుబాటులో లేదు.","walls":"ఈ చిత్రాన్ని డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయండి. ఈ చిత్రం వినియోగం వాల్‌పేపర్‌కి మాత్రమే పరిమితం చేయబడింది."}}
