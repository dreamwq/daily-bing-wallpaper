Male humpbacks are famous for their haunting songs, which can last up to 20 minutes and be heard over great distances underwater. Scientists aren’t sure why exactly the males sing these ballads, but some theorise it’s related to courtship. That sounds romantic enough, but ladies take note—the humpback isn’t one to settle down. It's a migratory animal that swims up to 25,000 kilometres a year, travelling from southern breeding grounds to Arctic waters like these.","date":"Feb 15, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200214_HumpbackHerring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ebbd8ff3caca2f07c5ab325bddafe543","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumpbackHerring_EN-IN7594483496_tmb.jpg","title":"Whales in winter","desc":"Wintertime brings large numbers of humpback whales to the icy waters off the Norwegian coast, where they feed on herring and krill—and…","hash":"kfP4zHqxChDpYvBZpGtCRJ4+QqwQ8hnsgUPFwZ0vUyU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"లోడ్ చేస్తోంది...","previous":"మునుపటి చిత్రం","next":"తదుపరి చిత్రం","walle":"ఈ చిత్రం వాల్‌పేపర్‌గా డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయడానికి అందుబాటులో లేదు.","walls":"ఈ చిత్రాన్ని డౌన్‌లోడ్ చేయండి. ఈ చిత్రం వినియోగం వాల్‌పేపర్‌కి మాత్రమే పరిమితం చేయబడింది."}}
