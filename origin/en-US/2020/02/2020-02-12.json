Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he published in his 1859 book 'On the Origin of Species.' During his travels to the Galápagos Islands years earlier, Darwin observed creatures that were similar from island to island but had slightly different adaptations to better survive in their specific environments. This became a key component of his research. The islands are home to thousands of unique species, including this Pinzon Island tortoise, which we see hatching from an egg at the Charles Darwin Research Station.","date":"Feb 12, 2020","bsTitle":"Wake up, it's Darwin Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200212_PinzonIslandTortoise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d9b4fcda4ff295614b653ab255fd1cf3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinzonIslandTortoise_EN-US4325314925_tmb.jpg","title":"Wake up, it's Darwin Day","desc":"On Charles Darwin's birthday, we celebrate Darwin Day—and, of course, there's no better place to do that than the Galápagos Islands.
