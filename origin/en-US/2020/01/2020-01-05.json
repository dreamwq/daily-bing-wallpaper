The birds use their beaks and talons to hollow out nesting spaces in soft limestone cliffs found in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The parrots sometimes end up captured and sold as pets for the wild bird trade. While that's not illegal—burrowing parrots aren't endangered—the capture and sale of these birds and others is part of the focus of National Bird Day in the United States, which is observed on January 5. National Bird Day was created to educate the public about the value of wild birds remaining wild. While keeping a parrot as a pet may seem like fun, the organizers of National Bird Day claim the parrot is going to be healthier and happier in its natural habitat.","date":"Jan 5, 2020","bsTitle":"Digging the birds","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200105_BurrowingParakeets%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2f955599166e3912a3c9c91a6e8b542f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BurrowingParakeets_EN-US8189174071_tmb.jpg","title":"Digging the birds","desc":"Burrowing parrots, sometimes called burrowing parakeets, are native to the arid Monte Desert of western Argentina.
