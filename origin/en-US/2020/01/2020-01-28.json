How did Cape Disappointment get its name? A British fur trader in 1788 mistook the mouth of the Columbia River for a bay and was disappointed because his ship couldn't pass due to the river's shallow bar. Many ships would eventually sink in these dangerous waters, but this lighthouse has warned off countless others since it was lit in 1856, making it the first lighthouse in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the lighthouses in the US have been built and maintained by the US Coast Guard and its predecessors.","date":"Jan 28, 2020","bsTitle":"US Coast Guard: Protecting us for 105 years","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200128_CapeDisappointment%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7d5f155890346d497494853982981d8d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapeDisappointment_EN-US8548904341_tmb.jpg","title":"US Coast Guard: Protecting us for 105 years","desc":"In recognition of the modern US Coast Guard, formed on this day in 1915, we're featuring the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse, one of many…","hash":"F1sivcNrM7Z9vLzIaNqZfJlqDDleu+haAemDnwFa77k="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
