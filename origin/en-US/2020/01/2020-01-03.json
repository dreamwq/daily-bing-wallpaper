Titled 'Field of Light,' it's currently on display at a venue called Sensorio in Paso Robles, California, the latest stop in a tour of sites around the world. At Sensorio, a new arts center that bills itself as representing 'the intersection of art, technology and nature,' visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibers, that change color. When the sun sets, the fibers illuminate, creating a shimmering, interactive landscape in the meadow. The art installation changes a bit at each site, but Munro tells reporters, 'The one constant is that it does make people smile.'","date":"Jan 3, 2020","bsTitle":"'Field of Light at Sensorio' by Bruce Munro","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200103_MunroLight%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"57cd47ba1df4a900e6dd9d09a3775883","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-US7297129449_tmb.jpg","title":"'Field of Light at Sensorio' by Bruce Munro","desc":"Artist Bruce Munro was camping at Uluru (aka Ayers Rock) in Australia in 1992 when he envisioned the art installation on today's homepage…","hash":"HtXHp5Y/tDi0kogVeouqgrca7qIWyd2jlnmBcySGaEM="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
