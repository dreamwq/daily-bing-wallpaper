These hard-working insects are key pollinators of flowers, like the sunflowers and lavender seen growing here. That’s why beekeepers have strategically placed these hives near the flower crops. Bees are also critical for the pollination of fruits and vegetables—about a third of the food we eat is a result of honeybee pollination. In the US, honeybees, whether tended by beekeepers or living in the wild, pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops every year. That's a lot of gold—and doesn't even include their delicious honey. So today on World Bee Day, we invite you to stop and smell the flowers and give a nod to the bees that help color our world.","date":"May 20, 2020","bsTitle":"It's World Bee Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200520_LavenderBee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be9be45befb553965cf63236f1dc7d2e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-US2922501458_tmb.jpg","title":"It's World Bee Day","desc":"Today we've buzzed to Provence, France, to enjoy this scenic view brought to you by bees.
