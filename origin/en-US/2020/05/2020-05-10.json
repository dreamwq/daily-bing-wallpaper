On Mother's Day, we're looking at a Burchell's zebra mother and foal. For the first two days after the foal is born, the mother will keep it close by and limit contact with other zebras, so the foal gets to know her by sight, smell, and sound. Over the next year, the foal will follow its mother, learning what to eat, where to migrate in the dry and rainy seasons, and how to avoid predators. Those might not be the exact skills your mom taught you, but she surely played a part in your survival and growth—so be sure to wish her a happy Mother's Day today.","date":"May 10, 2020","bsTitle":"Happy Mother's Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200510_ZebraMom%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be211d3ded993f70f9ae7ea72822bb13","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZebraMom_EN-US1905224456_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Mother's Day","desc":"Zebras can walk within 20 minutes of being born, but they still need help from mom.
