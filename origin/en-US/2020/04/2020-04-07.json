The same order of monks that established France's Mont-Saint-Michel built a church and priory here in the 12th century. In ensuing centuries of war, the insular monastic outpost was fortified into the imposing castle we see today. Privately purchased in 1659, the mount was opened to the public in 1954—and is still managed by members of the family that bought it over 350 years ago.","date":"Apr 7, 2020","bsTitle":"Once in a pink moon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200407_PinkMoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3cf25b85f796c5d9ad813a432bec6fb2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinkMoon_EN-US2450317197_tmb.jpg","title":"Once in a pink moon","desc":"We're seeing a vivid 'pink moon' rise above St. Michael's Mount—a granite-encrusted isle connected to the rugged peninsula of Cornwall…","hash":"HVtUHNgKyP6fd9DPVfN+N7ccymQFhfjHmlufEOPooXU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
