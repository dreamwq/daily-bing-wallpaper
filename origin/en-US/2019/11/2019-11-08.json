This historic church near Le Puy-en-Velay, France, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts visitors from around the world. It was constructed in 969 by a local bishop and dedicated to the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of mountaintops. Even before the chapel was built, the site had spiritual significance, as it was home to prehistoric dolmens (stone tombs) built by the Romans to honor their god Mercury.","date":"Nov 8, 2019","bsTitle":"Chapel on the rock","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191108_ChapelAiguilhe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"75f23dd4df5567b3a8cb3dc8e9031209","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-US4421310982_tmb.jpg","title":"Chapel on the rock","desc":"Pace yourself—you'll need to climb 268 stone steps to reach the entrance of Chapel St-Michel d'Aiguilhe (Chapel of St. Michael of the Needle…","hash":"KmRsyhsQX7xIFnGoeTTpSmAqvrEuQR0UYDyngCMjfew="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
