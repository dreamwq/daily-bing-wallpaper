The US is home to more than 30 million small businesses (500 employees or fewer), representing 47 percent of private sector employees. Of course, the concept of patronizing local merchants is nothing new. Here in Marrakesh, Morocco, souks (markets) like this one in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers, and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing, and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different specialties and takes on traditional Moroccan food.","date":"Nov 30, 2019","bsTitle":"A big place to shop small","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191130_MarrakechMarket%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fd89dea500c70b8f98c101b6c4960565","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-US9766644565_tmb.jpg","title":"A big place to shop small","desc":"Small Business Saturday started in 2010 to get shoppers out of the big box stores the day after Black Friday to support local retailers…","hash":"uEPPRYO+o7VIXT8qTEUeNpThDpW/Whlkkwdnk7gWHWc="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
