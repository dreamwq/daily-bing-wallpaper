Whenever temps drop low enough, many locals take to the ice and skate away on a complex network of canals. These waterways were built centuries ago—along with pumps, dikes, and the windmills pictured here—to protect the village of Kinderdijk by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem. Nowadays a modern water management system with multiple pumping stations does the work, and the windmills are left with a new job–to maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.","date":"Dec 27, 2019","bsTitle":"'Winterpret' on ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191227_KinderdijkSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"00f9266b9fbea443911af840d42170bd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-US3881873172_tmb.jpg","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk are embracing 'winterpret,' a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter fun.'

Then three years later, the vice president of Edison's company, Edward H. Johnson, had Christmas tree bulbs especially made, which he used to decorate the tree in his New York City home. Nevertheless, electric lights didn’t catch on as a holiday decoration among the general public until 1895, when President Grover Cleveland asked that the White House Christmas tree be illuminated by hundreds of multicolored electric bulbs.","date":"Dec 25, 2019","bsTitle":"Merry and bright","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191225_WarsawXmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"39238641754492169e405f3a8aa9937f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WarsawXmas_EN-US3496666406_tmb.jpg","title":"Merry and bright","desc":"Germans began decorating Christmas trees with candles as far back as the 1700s, but people wouldn't begin stringing trees with electric…","hash":"1JQvPCFGktA7HTVMNp5X2NycUV5TI2P8B8cMP5y8ZGk="}},{"startdate":"20191224","fullstartdate":"201912240800","enddate":"20191225","url":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerNorway_EN-US3428455299_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ReindeerNorway_EN-US3428455299","copyright":"A herd of reindeer in Norway (© Lena Granefelt/plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=reindeer&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191224_0800%22","title":"Dashing through the snow","caption":"Dashing through the snow","copyrightonly":"© Lena Granefelt/plainpicture","desc":"While many associate reindeer with the wonder of the holidays, these animals are magical in their own way.
