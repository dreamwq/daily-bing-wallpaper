The park sits at the edge of the North Pacific Ocean where frequent winter storms dump the snow that feeds this land of ice. The Harding Icefield crowns the park with at least 38 flowing glaciers—one of which is Exit Glacier. Exit Glacier is known for being one of the most visited of Alaska's glaciers, likely because it’s accessible via the Seward Highway. In mid-November, the road to the glacier closes to cars due to heavy snowfall, so visitors can only get there using snow-friendly transportation like dogsled or cross-country skis.","date":"Dec 2, 2019","bsTitle":"Wild and beautiful Alaska","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191202_AKParksDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d81d10fc9f3107d1f0df713d352cf794","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AKParksDay_EN-US9980950271_tmb.jpg","title":"Wild and beautiful Alaska","desc":"In honor of Alaska National Parks Day, we're traveling to Kenai Fjords National Park—home of the awe-inspiring Exit Glacier, seen here.
