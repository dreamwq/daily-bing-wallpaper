The annual event displays enormous champion pumpkins weighing over a thousand pounds, hosts live pumpkin-carving demonstrations, and offers really every kind of pumpkin-related food you can imagine, from pies to pumpkin-flavored artisanal cocktails. Plus, Gourdy, the anthropomorphized pumpkin mascot. While California is the leader in the consumer pumpkin harvest, it is only the second-largest producer in the country. Illinois grows approximately a quarter of the 2 billion pounds of pumpkins the US produces yearly, though 80 percent of that ends up as pie filling or other processed products. Pumpkins require between 90-120 days to mature, so most are planted by late May or early June to coincide with our Halloween carving needs.","date":"Oct 19, 2019","bsTitle":"The height of pumpkin season","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191019_HalfMoonBayPumpkin%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d9b98f4f80b7f6c9e98c66bd770326e6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-US1382713390_tmb.jpg","title":"The height of pumpkin season","desc":"If you happen to be in the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, you might want to swing by the Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival.
