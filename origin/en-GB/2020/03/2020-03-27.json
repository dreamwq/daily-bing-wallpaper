This 20m (66ft) long bridge spans the chasm between the mainland and Carrick-a-Rede Island, which takes its name from the Irish ‘Carraig a’ Ráid’ or ‘rock of the casting’. No-one lives in the restored fisherman’s cottage on the island now but at one time it was the place to go to catch migrating salmon, and it is fishermen who built the first bridge here in 1755. If you think today’s bridge looks daunting, you should’ve seen some of its earlier incarnations. As late as the 1970s there was only one handrail, not to mention large gaps between the slats.","date":"27 Mar 2020","bsTitle":"High and dry","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200327_CarrickSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"db15f7d16699a422414a061c3f04a601","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarrickSpring_EN-GB2555769601_tmb.jpg","title":"A bridge for the brave","desc":"A head for heights is definitely required here at one of Northern Ireland’s most eye-catching attractions, the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge…","hash":"y9YoNFiwvyTNxYmyZqNyRrrtLu5egsXzfW6vHitu++Y="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
