Watsonantheo/SuperStock","desc":"Like the napping African leopard in today's image, you might be feeling a little tired after losing an hour of sleep when the clocks went forward at 1am, as we switch to daylight saving time. The good news is, you’ll be repaid with lighter evenings from now on. In the UK, clocks always go forward one hour on the last Sunday in March and go back an hour on the last Sunday in October. We’ve been switching to BST (British Summer Time), since World War One so you’d think we’d be used to it by now. But it’s tiring losing that hour in bed, so maybe take a leaf out of our leopard’s book and grab a cat nap if you can.","date":"29 Mar 2020","bsTitle":"Feeling tired?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200329_LeopardNamibia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"06369c17dba8a436de8256b331ee0da8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeopardNamibia_EN-GB7633890518_tmb.jpg","title":"A good day for a nap","desc":"Like the napping African leopard in today's image, you might be feeling a little tired after losing an hour of sleep when the clocks went…","hash":"pO+5wkY3za7RdtyLoL2+uq2scY77k4M7aJ3Ee8DdF3c="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
