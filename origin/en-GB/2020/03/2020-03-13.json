This small, nearly circular tarn just north of Windermere reflects surrounding fells in its clear waters which, in the summer, are decorated with water lillies. Of the 16 lakes in the Lake District, only one is actually called a lake – that’s Bassenthwaite Lake. All the others are “meres” or “waters”. And then there are numerous smaller tarns like this one - \"tarn\" is derived from the Old Norse word for pool.","date":"13 Mar 2020","bsTitle":"Mirror on the fells","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200313_LoughriggTarn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e64843e7eb77328e9a7ce36bb09330ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LoughriggTarn_EN-GB5418287139_tmb.jpg","title":"Reflecting the beauty of the fells","desc":"As the sun rises on Loughrigg Tarn, in the heart of the Lake District, you can see why the poet William Wordsworth likened it to Italy’s…","hash":"LdKh/ylQPH58euPkAyu6df6U4tgBO/B02BakwN7RwMY="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
