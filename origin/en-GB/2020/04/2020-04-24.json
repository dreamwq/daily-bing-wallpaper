Most penguins slide over the ice on their bellies, but these small penguins are a bit more aerobic - they hop. Rockhoppers are among the most common penguin species but pollution, overfishing and climate change have taken a toll. Their population has declined by about 30 percent over the last 30 years. Today, there are an estimated 1.5 million breeding pairs of rockhoppers. About 1 million of those are southern rockhopper couples – the rest are made up of the northern and eastern rockhoppers.","date":"25 Apr 2020","bsTitle":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200424_FalklandRockhoppers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3afe081a3d05400a87c33f90ae5f36c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-GB2947648355_tmb.jpg","title":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","desc":"For World Penguin Day, we're featuring a lively group of southern rockhopper penguins on a Falkland Islands beach.
