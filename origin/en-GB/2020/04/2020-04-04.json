Its small size, friendly face and low-maintenance lifestyle make it a popular choice with frog-loving Americans. In the UK there are two native species of frog, the - very rare - pool frog and the common frog. The frogspawn spotted in slow moving streams and ponds in the spring is likely to be that of the common frog – which, despite the name, is actually quite rare in much of the countryside. Tadpoles usually start to appear here in April.","date":"5 Apr 2020","bsTitle":"The frog prince?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200404_KissimmeeFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e6753bfb43a7407e243aa115e1be2b05","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-GB7835022432_tmb.jpg","title":"The frog prince?","desc":"Perched among the petals of a purple water lily, this little green treefrog is a common pet in parts of the US, where it can be found in…","hash":"YzA3AgdSOnfBs+ulkR9t1zpPuo3R0+/fxddRLjCVsUc="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
