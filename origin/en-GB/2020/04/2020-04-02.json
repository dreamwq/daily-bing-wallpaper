Scottish explorer David Livingstone named the waterfall in honour of Queen Victoria, although it's also known by its indigenous Lozi name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means 'the smoke that thunders'. According to some records, local villagers described the waterfall to Livingstone as 'Seongo' or 'Chongwe', which means 'the place of the rainbow', because rainbows appear in its spray. Under a bright moon, you might also see a 'moonbow' here.","date":"3 Apr 2020","bsTitle":"Follow the rainbow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200402_PlaceofRainbows%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1c8148b6cc80e44a246ea1cf85ba7d5f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-GB6944289342_tmb.jpg","title":"Follow the rainbow","desc":"Welcome to Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, a great place to mark Find a Rainbow Day…","hash":"gh6PWy3sQSooxpIpoJ2YmvfULAWj7tK4y8qP33FUz9s="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
