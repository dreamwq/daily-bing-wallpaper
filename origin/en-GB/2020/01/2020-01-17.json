While seabirds like the cormorant are a threat to them, these mackerel aren't totally defenceless. Fish have many ways of protecting themselves, including travelling in dense schools like this one. It's a technique which not only allows for speedy travel (because it reduces friction on most of the fish in the school) it also makes it more difficult for predators to pick out an individual victim.
