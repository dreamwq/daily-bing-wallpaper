Construction on this fortress was started in the 14th century by the Grand Duke of Lithuania and completed years later by his son. It served as a strategic and bustling centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a former European state. Like much architecture from so long ago, the castle was damaged and fell into disrepair, only to be reconstructed and reopened as a museum. These days it’s known as one of Europe’s most striking medieval castles.","date":"6 Jan 2020","bsTitle":"Fortress of solitude","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200106_TrakaiLithuania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"23966658cd478eefaa777021430972f8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrakaiLithuania_EN-GB2734569400_tmb.jpg","title":"The island castle of Trakai","desc":"Our homepage castle might look like something out of a fairy tale but it can be found in one of the larger islands of Lake Galvé in the…","hash":"VmdNfmQ0OGQ/T52PcqtGDSc8lJn36sC7f4NrF5BX/Pk="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
