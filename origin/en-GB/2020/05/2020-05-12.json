The 52m (170ft) high concrete dam brings a dramatic component to the scenic valley of the Rheidol river, as well as holding back up to 26,000 million litres of water. Covering 680 acres, Nant-y-Moch (which translates as the pig’s stream) is the larger of two reservoirs which help funnel rainwater down the mountains.","date":"13 May 2020","bsTitle":"Holding back the tide","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200512_NantyMoch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"478cf543d48cd972eb98f0d1e9e030f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NantyMoch_EN-GB3460762439_tmb.jpg","title":"Holding back the tide","desc":"We’re looking down on the Nant-y-Moch reservoir and dam, part of the huge Rheidol Hydro Electric scheme which begins high up in the Cambrian…","hash":"xhB3V86sPrK1cxVScmbsr4q25cz2FW98egKmpDTHMIU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
