Today, Jeff Hanson is a successful artist who only vaguely sees shapes and colours. Although legally blind, he's developed a unique process that helps him feel his compositions by first plastering the canvas with a thick plastic substance. Once that hardens, he uses the ridges to navigate a piece, before adding his signature vibrant colour. He sells his art to fans like Warren Buffett, Elton John and other collectors.","date":"21 May 2020","bsTitle":"A visionary artist","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200520_JeffHanson%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"f9075338c97d6aa2d819bacce7bc0ef0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffHanson_EN-GB9142333406_tmb.jpg","title":"A visionary artist with a vibrant outlook","desc":"These colourful flowers were painted by an artist who has been visually impaired since he was a boy, after a brain tumour damaged his optic…","hash":"Sjvi+GMioJJsyFhaKWMJ+GfSti1NKA7z0LwMOFlmfLM="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
