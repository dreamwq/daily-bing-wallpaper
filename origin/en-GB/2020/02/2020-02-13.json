It offers views out onto the largest natural lake in south Wales and a tiny man-made island called Ynys Bwlc, which is thought to have been there since around 900 AD. The island was built as a crannog, an ancient lake dwelling of which there are hundreds in Scotland and Ireland, but only this one in Wales. Although there is no building on the island itself now, it is thought to have once been home to royalty, constructed by the King of Brycheiniog, then a small kingdom in this part of Wales.","date":"13 Feb 2020","bsTitle":"Life on the lake","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200213_CrannogLlangorse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"07d3cd45b78c99976c23e968482e64f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrannogLlangorse_EN-GB4801622540_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake life in the Dark Ages","desc":"This traditionally built roundhouse jutting out into Llangorse Lake is the Welsh Crannog Centre – a great place to get some insight into…","hash":"vg4EuEh/HEKuOajPkzJ9qxczQqvDi3rVsnwCjeqh+cQ="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
