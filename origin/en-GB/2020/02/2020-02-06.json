Taken as a sign that the long winter is finally on its way out, they can actually bloom as early as January, when there’s still snow underfoot and quite a bit of winter left to go. Their leaves have specially hardened tips, to help them push through frosty ground.  Plant enough bulbs, or come across a naturally occurring patch, and it can look like a light dusting of winter snow has coated the ground. Need a little hope to get you through this last stretch of winter? Look no further than the lovely snowdrop.","date":"6 Feb 2020","bsTitle":"Signs of spring?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200206_SneezeSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4b3748958795f6608a4a653ad07a12c7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-GB0217805831_tmb.jpg","title":"A hint of spring","desc":"Snowdrops are a welcome sight during the first few months of the year here in the UK.
