Most begin in October or early November and remain in that state until springtime. During hibernation, an animal's heart rate and breathing slow and its body temperature drops.

Others – like badgers – will become less active as they survive on reserves of body fat, so although you see less of them, they are not actually hibernating.","date":"12 Nov 2019","bsTitle":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191112_BabyHedgehog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1ad0ba1cd5d7ad33d83a9a5917a5a1bf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-GB1053695179_tmb.jpg","title":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","desc":"As the cooler weather sets in, hedgehogs are preparing to hibernate.
