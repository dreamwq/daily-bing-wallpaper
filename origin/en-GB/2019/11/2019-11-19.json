Spectacular by day or by dusk, Tantallon has perched high on the cliff edge here since it was built for nobleman William Douglas in the mid 14th century. The house of Douglas split into two branches, the Black and the Red, and it was the Red Douglas dynasty which owned the castle for three centuries, occasionally clashing with the Crown. Tantallon saw off sieges in 1491 and 1528 but was finally left in ruins by Oliver Cromwell’s troops in 1651.","date":"19 Nov 2019","bsTitle":"Clifftop castle","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191119_TantallonSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81fa36f98534b1f42e7757efbbe1f627","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TantallonSunset_EN-GB0900265436_tmb.jpg","title":"Towering Tantallon","desc":"Welcome to Seacliff Beach in East Lothian and its enviable view of the last of Scotland’s mighty medieval fortresses, Tantallon Castle…","hash":"YJfy1ur5iW3Hb8dCt3tjpUP3Zi9H2Bp7YaSVzeCFLdA="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
