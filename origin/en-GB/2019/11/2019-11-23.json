The leaves on the Queen Victoria agave in today's image also express the sequence as they spiral out from the centre. It can be found throughout nature and art, from the structure of shells to the composition of Renaissance paintings. This unique set of numbers was introduced to Europe in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (posthumously named Fibonacci) in his revolutionary work the 'Liber Abaci'. The book showed how switching to the Hindu-Arabic numeral system or 'Modus Indorum’ – 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - could simplify calculations and trade, at a time when most of Europe was using Roman numerals.","date":"23 Nov 2019","bsTitle":"1, 1, 2, 3: It's Fibonacci Day!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191123_QueenVictoriaAgave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"953cdbb9d9c940d698223b756b900f83","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QueenVictoriaAgave_EN-GB5071571830_tmb.jpg","title":"1, 1, 2, 3: It's Fibonacci Day!","desc":"Today's date (written US-style) is 11/23, or 1, 1, 2, 3 - a Fibonacci sequence of numbers.
