Today, 30 November, marks the start of Scotland’s three winter festivals – the others being Hogmanay and Burns Night – and is celebrated with traditional food and drink, music and dancing. St Andrew is patron saint of a number of countries including Russia and Romania and there are various stories about how he ended up being patron saint of Scotland. One involves a 9th Century king of the Picts, Oengus II, who saw white clouds form an “X” in the sky before battle against the Angles – a bit like our homepage image today. It was taken as a sign and he vowed that if he won the battle, he would make St Andrew the patron saint of Scotland. He did!","date":"30 Nov 2019","bsTitle":"St Andrew's Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191130_SaltireClouds%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a85ec3ec00c7c1442ad6172bb59f2cfd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaltireClouds_EN-GB1504522042_tmb.jpg","title":"A misty Saltire for St Andrew's Day","desc":"These low-lying clouds reflected in Loch Chon have created a misty Saltire – the perfect picture to see in St Andrew's Day and celebrate…","hash":"PCZK/7Mncsrg5fq+THzAoc0HVKCdvQCGnnMXMf6QG7I="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
