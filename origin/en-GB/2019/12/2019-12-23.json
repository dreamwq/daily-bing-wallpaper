Or perhaps they are simply participating in the tongue-in-cheek observance Festivus – popularised by the US comedy Seinfeld. Made up by American writer Daniel O’Keefe, it was rebranded as a rejection of Christmas-season commercialism  in a 1997 episode of the sitcom, complete with alternative traditions such as the ‘Airing of Grievances’. Having said that, gentoo penguins mainly use their signature trumpeting call in mating rituals – so it’s perfectly possible these two lovebirds are on a date. Anyway, happy Festivus! Or Christmas Eve Eve, if you prefer.","date":"23 Dec 2019","bsTitle":"Festive stress?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191223_AiringGrievances%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ce155234150e92daef393a472c9e1e49","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-GB2301817471_tmb.jpg","title":"Festive stress or flirting?","desc":"The run-up to Christmas can be a bit stressful, as demonstrated by our two gentoo penguins in Antarctica, who appear to be getting things…","hash":"RIdZ3orX8h4pPM5C/a2IacKLNtWkVoim9XZKD2gbJok="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
