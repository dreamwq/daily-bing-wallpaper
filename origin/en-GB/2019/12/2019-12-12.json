But on 12 December they will have to contend with something more invasive than the wind chill factor. Sheep-Cote Clod, the first of the 13 Yule Lads, is due to visit. Who’s that, you say? The Yule Lads are white-bearded brothers of Icelandic folklore who, in the run-up to Christmas, wreak havoc and leave small gifts – or rotten potatoes, depending on behaviour – in shoes left out by children.","date":"12 Dec 2019","bsTitle":"Here's looking at ewe","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191212_SheepCoteClod%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f266a2bfb2124aa8e94b46654d96f599","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-GB1694811487_tmb.jpg","title":"On the lookout for Sheep-Cote Clod","desc":"You're looking at one of the oldest breeds of sheep in the world.
