Trumpeters tend to stay put year-round if they have access to enough open water. But if the water freezes in winter, they'll migrate far enough south to find wetlands where they can eat the aquatic plants that make up the bulk of their diet. That may be why the swans in this image are drawn to the waters of Kelly Warm Springs in the US state of Wyoming, which don't freeze, even if snow lines the banks. Trumpeters are among the largest types of swan. The biggest known cob - that's a male swan - weighed nearly 18kg (almost three stone) and had a 10ft (3m) wingspan.","date":"28 Dec 2019","bsTitle":"Have they forgotten to fly south?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191228_TrumpeterWinter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d115123fafb9bf018a8eb659afeedbfc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-GB7932740173_tmb.jpg","title":"Have they forgotten to fly south?","desc":"Trumpeter swans live near rivers, lakes and coastal roads in northern and western US states, Canada and Alaska.

These waterways were built centuries ago, along with pumps, dykes and the windmills pictured here, to protect the village of Kinderdijk from flooding by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level. Nowadays a modern water management system with pumping stations does much of the work while the windmills maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a Unesco World Heritage site.","date":"27 Dec 2019","bsTitle":"'Winterpret' on ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191227_KinderdijkSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"e0a1bcfbfc42f31ac05f9bebc786b519","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-GB6970700957_tmb.jpg","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk in the Netherlands are embracing 'winterpret’, a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter…","hash":"QyomnBAkgnJJV09EaH03ome/u4qfaFVdVPBEx+i8Yr0="}},{"startdate":"20191226","fullstartdate":"201912260000","enddate":"20191227","url":"/th?id=OHR.RubberDucks_EN-GB5021968595_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.RubberDucks_EN-GB5021968595","copyright":"Rubber duck race for Boxing Day  (© Jessica Lynn Culver/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Boxing+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191226_0000%22","title":"Happy Boxing Day!","caption":"The rubber ducks (and other quirky customs) of Boxing Day","copyrightonly":"© Jessica Lynn Culver/Getty Images","desc":"Happy Boxing Day!
