This small peninsula and Chesil Beach, which attaches it to the mainland, have seen numerous shipwrecks over the centuries. The Romans are thought to have lit beacons here, to warn boats off its reefs, ledges and tidal surges.  Portland Bill Lighthouse, at the southern tip of the peninsula, is a popular tourist attraction and if you can climb the 153 steps to the lantern room, you will be rewarded with sweeping views of the sea and of Dorset’s beautiful Jurassic Coast.","date":"2 Dec 2019","bsTitle":"A guiding light","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191202_PortlandDawn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cb9403a41c80e6d17d6b0530cbc0ea53","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PortlandDawn_EN-GB5749585579_tmb.jpg","title":"Shedding light on stormy waters","desc":"Welcome to the Isle of Portland and its striking red and white lighthouse, which has been warning seafarers off the treacherous rocks and…","hash":"kvB2CHaL0lEPGZ5Nwv2Onicd/3ZhkYHvgAyFZax/emY="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
