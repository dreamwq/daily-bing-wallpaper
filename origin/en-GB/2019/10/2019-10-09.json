Already over seven light-years across and expanding at a rate of over four million mph, the ’bubble’ is actually the shock wave created when expanding hot gas (or stellar wind) hits the cold, interstellar gas that surrounds it. The Bubble nebula was discovered in 1787 by German-born British astronomer William Herschel. The star inside is living fast and will die young (for a star) - it will likely detonate as a supernova in 10 to 20 million years.","date":"10 Oct 2019","bsTitle":"A star blows a bubble","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191009_BubbleNebula%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e3c5eb2954a023715173bb5fccf228b2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BubbleNebula_EN-GB8740432780_tmb.jpg","title":"A star blows a bubble","desc":"This giant space bubble is being blown by a massive star visible at the 10 o'clock position inside it.
