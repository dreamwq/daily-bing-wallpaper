About 60 miles south east of the city of Buffalo, the 17-mile-long park protects a stunning section of the Genesee River that cuts through a deep gorge. The cliffs, close to 600 feet high in some places, offer knockout views of several waterfalls and the thick deciduous forest. The historic Glen Iris Inn, once the home and refuge of industrialist William Pryor Letchworth, overlooks Middle Falls. In 1906, Letchworth bequeathed his 1,000-acre (1.6 square mile) estate to the state of New York. The parcel would become the heart of the park that bears his name.","date":"9 Oct 2019","bsTitle":"Chasing waterfalls","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191008_GrandCanyonEast%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"80c5bf10cf9c328fec0badfa27db4e02","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GrandCanyonEast_EN-GB8199247927_tmb.jpg","title":"The Grand Canyon of New York","desc":"It's easy to see why Letchworth State Park in New York is known in the US as the Grand Canyon of the East.
