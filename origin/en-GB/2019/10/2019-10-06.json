Featuring the architect’s signature curves and deconstructed appearance, the building consists of three different parts. There is a medical building with spaces for patient care and research, a for-hire event space which helps fund the centre's research and an open courtyard connecting the two spaces. Some have likened these elements to the hemispheres of the brain itself, with the medical building representing rational thinking and the event space giving form to creative thinking.","date":"7 Oct 2019","bsTitle":"Ahead of the curve","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191006_LouRuvo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"2cc2e822dc7dea2dad4f5198c9a8d7ae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LouRuvo_EN-GB6646250971_tmb.jpg","title":"From the mind of Frank Gehry","desc":"Today's image features the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Centre for Brain Health in Las Vegas, USA, designed by world-renowned architect Frank…","hash":"O1Daf8rUXJ3/9/on/LYime/GZoibMGqKtHQkENCoMgU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
