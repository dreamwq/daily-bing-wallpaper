Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire roundtrip route clocks in at about 20,000 kilometres, making grey whales among the longest migrators of animal kingdom. Because they travel close to the coastline, it's also one of the few whale migrations you can see from shore.","date":"Mar 26, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200325_NoCaliCoast%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a0a4e7764a0900f4b636f0f257f36f92","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NoCaliCoast_EN-IN6713610410_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey days ahead","desc":"In late winter and early spring, thousands of grey whales, many with calves in tow, swim by this part of the Pacific coast as they migrate…","hash":"mzO0hiHHAZYpSKp+uPeZ6k+bG5YjEIPwFMBJedPhP30="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ਲੋਡ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ...","previous":"ਪਿਛਲਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ","next":"ਅਗਲਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ","walle":"ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਵਾਲਪੇਪਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਡਾਉਨਲੋਡ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ।","walls":"ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਡਾਉਨਲੋਡ ਕਰੋ। ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਦਾ ਉਪਯੋਗ ਕੇਵਲ ਵਾਲਪੇਪਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਪਾਬੰਦ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ।"}}
