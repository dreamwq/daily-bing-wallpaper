This small peninsula and Chesil Beach, which attaches it to the mainland, have seen numerous shipwrecks over the centuries. The Romans are thought to have lit beacons here, to warn boats off its reefs, ledges and tidal surges.  Portland Bill Lighthouse, at the southern tip of the peninsula, is a popular tourist attraction and if you can climb the 153 steps to the lantern room, you will be rewarded with sweeping views of the sea and of Dorset’s beautiful Jurassic Coast.","date":"Dec 2, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191201_PortlandDawn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d84022a86cb3c21aa42db274df8b891c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PortlandDawn_EN-IN2067536395_tmb.jpg","title":"Shedding light on stormy waters","desc":"Welcome to the Isle of Portland and its striking red and white lighthouse, which has been warning seafarers off the treacherous rocks and…","hash":"kvB2CHaL0lEPGZ5Nwv2Onicd/3ZhkYHvgAyFZax/emY="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ਲੋਡ ਕੀਤਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ...","previous":"ਪਿਛਲਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ","next":"ਅਗਲਾ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ","walle":"ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਵਾਲਪੇਪਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਡਾਉਨਲੋਡ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ।","walls":"ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਡਾਉਨਲੋਡ ਕਰੋ। ਇਹ ਪ੍ਰਤੀਬਿੰਬ ਦਾ ਉਪਯੋਗ ਕੇਵਲ ਵਾਲਪੇਪਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਪਾਬੰਦ ਕੀਤਾ ਹੈ।"}}
