They come in such vast numbers that it’s thought to be one of the largest concentrations of mammals in the world. From the end of October to mid-December, these large fruit-eating bats pack into a small area in the forest to roost. But when the sun begins to set, they start to swarm, darkening the skies as they head out to gorge on fruit in the Mushitu swamp forest. Experts believe their migration starts about 3,200 kilometres north, in Congo.","date":"Oct 29, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191028_EidolonHelvum%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"deeaca5adc08b5c200abb1c7fd062eef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-IN4483380253_tmb.jpg","title":"And the skies filled with bats…","desc":"As if right on cue for Halloween, this is the time of year when millions of straw-coloured fruit bats begin to descend on Zambia's Kasanka…","hash":"aeCemtOsiCz8VWV7H1sSLfuq0t1IKqvTCy3mrYQyxvk="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"लोड हो रहा है...","previous":"पिछली छवि","next":"अगली छवि","walle":"यह छवि वॉलपेपर के रूप में डाउनलोड करने के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं है.","walls":"इस छवि को डाउनलोड करें. इस छवि का उपयोग केवल वॉलपेपर तक प्रतिबंधित है."}}
