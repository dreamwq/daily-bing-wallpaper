The event was established in 2012 to encourage acts of generosity during the holidays, when consumerism seems to be the focus for so many. Giving Tuesday was started by a small nonprofit and with the help of social media campaigns, it's grown into a global movement. In 2018, Giving Tuesday participants raised US$400 million. Of course, you don't have to give money to participate. Organisers urge folks to volunteer or take a cue from our homepage puffins, and simply show kindness to one another.
