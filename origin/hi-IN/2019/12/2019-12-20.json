In India, you could experience snowflakes in some parts of the Himalayan region). Until the advent of macro- and micro-photography in the late 1800s, it was impossible to study the structure of snowflakes—they melted too quickly to be accurately sketched under a microscope. Enter Wilson 'Snowflake' Bentley. A farmer and self-trained scientist from Jericho, Vermont (New England region, USA), Bentley was the first person to successfully photograph an individual snowflake. Over his lifetime, he would produce over 5,000 different images, a feat that led him to be the first to observe that every snowflake is unique.","date":"Dec 21, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191220_RealSnowflake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a1d9a306adc19013e9815457168348f5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RealSnowflake_EN-IN9355894356_tmb.jpg","title":"You've never seen anything like this","desc":"This macrophotograph of a snowflake shows the classic, six-sided structure that people come to associate with this tiny winter marvel (in…","hash":"Dx+1C8gpxSaBmEG/tsmVhrEEfOlXR7PbpDFs61iBC9U="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"लोड हो रहा है...","previous":"पिछली छवि","next":"अगली छवि","walle":"यह छवि वॉलपेपर के रूप में डाउनलोड करने के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं है.","walls":"इस छवि को डाउनलोड करें. इस छवि का उपयोग केवल वॉलपेपर तक प्रतिबंधित है."}}
