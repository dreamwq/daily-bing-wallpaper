Each year the count runs from December 14 to January 5, giving bird lovers across North America a chance to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The findings recorded by participants are collected and used to gauge the health of various bird populations. This information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas.","date":"Dec 14, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191213_SpruceGrouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7304bdf7606b616b0dcc242828433417","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505_tmb.jpg","title":"American Bird Count begins","desc":"Today marks the start of the annual Christmas Bird Count, a bird census sponsored by the National Audubon Society (a US-based non-profit…","hash":"ZfpUOf6dHm9c6nh0sYPCL+F0zTQavJbAsntLvNuUcKc="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"लोड हो रहा है...","previous":"पिछली छवि","next":"अगली छवि","walle":"यह छवि वॉलपेपर के रूप में डाउनलोड करने के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं है.","walls":"इस छवि को डाउनलोड करें. इस छवि का उपयोग केवल वॉलपेपर तक प्रतिबंधित है."}}
