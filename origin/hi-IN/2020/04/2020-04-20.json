The vivid colours here are formed due to a cycle of hot water rising, cooling, and falling--creating rings of distinct temperatures inside the spring. The clear, blue centre is the hottest part, with almost nothing living in it. But the other rings are home to different organisms that give the water its rings of colour. While it’s beautiful to look at, you wouldn’t want to swim in it. It’s illegal, but it’s also much too hot—and the sulfur smell wouldn’t leave you feeling too clean.","date":"Apr 21, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200420_GPS%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3d9219f3ce395f32a46ab69d36b5b1b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-IN0032050115_tmb.jpg","title":"Colours spring up in Yellowstone","desc":"Today we’re taking a look at the Grand Prismatic Spring, one of the more popular attractions in Yellowstone National Park, USA.
