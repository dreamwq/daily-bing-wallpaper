Jones/Minden Pictures","desc":"As the days lengthen and spring flowers bloom in Wyoming(USA), herds of pronghorns, native to interior western and central North America - migrate northwards to the Grand Tetons National Park. The journey, which biologists have dubbed the 'Path of the Pronghorn,' covers about 250 kilometres across government and private lands. Pronghorns have walked this route since prehistoric times, though today, fences, highways, and other unnatural barriers have made the journey more perilous. To help, wildlife corridors are being constructed over highways and under bridges to offer safer passage for these quintessential symbols of the American West. Conservation efforts like these have helped to make the 'Path of the Pronghorn' one of the longest migration corridors remaining for large mammals in North America.","date":"Apr 4, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200403_Pronghorn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f89f62446747ffff1001d448af0f9e88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Pronghorn_EN-IN6632020187_tmb.jpg","title":"March of the pronghorns","desc":"As the days lengthen and spring flowers bloom in Wyoming(USA), herds of pronghorns, native to interior western and central North America…","hash":"/RcboZVwHyACNpQW/JtYICqfZnjBJre+Pt5S7Dgb/L0="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"लोड हो रहा है...","previous":"पिछली छवि","next":"अगली छवि","walle":"यह छवि वॉलपेपर के रूप में डाउनलोड करने के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं है.","walls":"इस छवि को डाउनलोड करें. इस छवि का उपयोग केवल वॉलपेपर तक प्रतिबंधित है."}}
