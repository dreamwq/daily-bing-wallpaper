Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above.

Together they cover 20,813 square kilometres, with the East park consisting of flat, dry plains, and the West including mountains, volcanoes, lakes, and springs. The gerenuk (which means giraffe-necked antelope in Somali) is a long-necked antelope also known as the giraffe gazelle. It uses its lengthy neck and ability to stand on its hind legs to nibble on shrubs and trees that other types of antelope can't reach. It's less social then other gazelles, so seeing one alone, as we are in this photo, is common.","date":"Sep 10, 2019","bsTitle":"Lone rangers","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190909_TsavoGerenuk%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"186dac5db20179aba860e0511bcc38b5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TsavoGerenuk_EN-AU2180252707_tmb.jpg","title":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","desc":"It's peak tourist season in the Tsavo region of Kenya, when the weather's cooler and dry - a good time to spot wildlife like this gerenuk in…","hash":"FiGE9tQp4PBXNRvPnawI2O5yh6Bo8vwEasc1h3YCstM="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
