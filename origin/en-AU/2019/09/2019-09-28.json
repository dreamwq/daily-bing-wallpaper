And soon the 600 wineries in this smallest Spanish province will begin the lengthy process to turn this year's grape harvest into its world-famous Rioja wines. (To get an idea of how tiny the Rioja province is, it makes up just one per cent of Spain's land area and only about 0.67 per cent of Spain's population lives here.) While winemaking techniques have evolved and improved over the thousands of years that wine has been made here, each year around this time locals and visitors gather in the capital of Logroño to celebrate the wine harvest and see a traditional example of the first, uh, step of this process - crushing newly harvested grapes by stomping them with bare feet.","date":"Sep 29, 2019","bsTitle":"Falling for Rioja","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190928_ClavijoLandscape%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"41240a7f6c19aff43b96c3e23fe59223","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ClavijoLandscape_EN-AU6059927981_tmb.jpg","title":"Falling for Rioja","desc":"While today's image of the Spanish region of Rioja is serene and peaceful, the people of this area are hard at work harvesting grapes at…","hash":"5/QCGcd+i72Jk2swX3WyYsryPCtAyyfN8jqtZh2ygzk="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
