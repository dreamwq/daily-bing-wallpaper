Fewer than 2,000 people visited back in 1919 due to poor road conditions and lack of trails. These days, the park has the opposite problem - with more than four million people coming each year, crowds create long lines for shuttles and clog popular areas such as the Narrows. Part of Zion Canyon, the Narrows can be seen from a paved path. But many people like to experience it up close, hiking in the Virgin River, and it can get crowded at peak times since it's - as the name implies - narrow.","date":"Nov 19, 2019","bsTitle":"Zion National Park Turns 100","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191118_ZionBirthday%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6720ec25bec1b08990e4fbdb970f4340","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZionBirthday_EN-AU2162250567_tmb.jpg","title":"Zion National Park Turns 100","desc":"It's been exactly 100 years since American President Woodrow Wilson signed an act to convert Mukuntuweap National Monument into Zion…","hash":"bKHFBOAIK/l2NmToT37uC/9lh58GeN/stl0KBYa1aiU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
