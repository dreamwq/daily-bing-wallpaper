Whenever temps drop low enough, many locals take to the ice and skate away on a complex network of canals. These waterways were built centuries ago - along with pumps, dykes, and the windmills pictured here - to protect the village of Kinderdijk by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem. Nowadays a modern water management system with multiple pumping stations does the work, and the windmills are left with a new job - to maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.","date":"Dec 27, 2019","bsTitle":"'Winterpret' on ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191226_KinderdijkSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"7242f6d6901141bf7a9e6488921dfd4f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-AU7743172032_tmb.jpg","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk are embracing 'winterpret’, a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter fun’.
