Each year the count runs from December 14 to January 5, giving bird lovers across North America a chance to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The findings recorded by participants are collected and used to gauge the health of various bird populations. This information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas.","date":"Dec 14, 2019","bsTitle":"The Christmas Bird Count begins","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191213_SpruceGrouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d959c3778667c6647bbb1e80d80352cb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-AU7185900867_tmb.jpg","title":"The Christmas Bird Count begins","desc":"Today marks the start of the annual Christmas Bird Count in the US, a bird census sponsored by the country’s National Audubon Society that…","hash":"qbaUZTIl8VJBA/FUoo7n4JRkrMDRp5Xn3K3eJ07oGkI="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
