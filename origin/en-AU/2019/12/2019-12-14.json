On the morning of December 16, 1944, the beleaguered German army threw its best remaining troops and armour against a lightly defended section of the American and Allied line. Bad weather neutralised Allied air superiority and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a 'bulge' in its offensive west into Belgium. Desperate to hold the line, US General Eisenhower sent the country’s 101st Airborne Division to hold the strategically important crossroads in Bastogne.","date":"Dec 15, 2019","bsTitle":"The Battle of the Bulge 75 years later","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191214_NutsWeekend%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1af5c4097eac8d895935892c5feef00a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-AU7528561846_tmb.jpg","title":"The Battle of the Bulge 75 years later","desc":"Seventy-five years ago this week, the Battle of the Bulge (the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during WWII) began…","hash":"QBu9veLXx5jT6eIRU1XEaLxQr36U51F0CLF4hEgopWI="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
