In the 18th century, during the reign of the Qing dynasty of China, Emperor Qinglong ordered the construction of this 2.8 square kilometre collection of gardens, lakes, and various structures including temples and small palaces. Today it's one of Beijing's premier attractions and will be crowded today with visitors headed to the bridge in time for sunset.","date":"Dec 22, 2019","bsTitle":"Seventeen arches at sunset","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191221_SeventeenSolstice%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9f666a0aec92d203c0b5a11c789963b2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-AU5824843529_tmb.jpg","title":"Seventeen arches at sunset","desc":"When it's winter solstice time in the Northern Hemisphere (where the North Pole has its maximum tilt away from the Sun), the setting sun…","hash":"kgtP44pR+gvDLU37R/MtQgfs+ut/dKabygqzwnq9Mto="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
