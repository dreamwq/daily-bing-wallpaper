Yes, running for its sixth year up until January 7 (to coincide with Orthodox Christmas), the tree is just a stone’s throw from the beloved Carousel, allowing locals and tourists alike to come together and marvel at its bright lights as the sun goes down. Visitors can enjoy a six-minute show that takes place four times an hour, and to encourage repeat visits, there are three variations of the show – each with a different light display and music track.","date":"Dec 19, 2019","bsTitle":"Christmas comes to Geelong","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191218_GeelongChristmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"d89e07d8f3dae7346fd47a732995e705","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GeelongChristmas_EN-AU8356368393_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas comes to Geelong","desc":"Australia might lack the snowy scenes common to much of the northern hemisphere, so today we’re embracing the warmth and taking you to…","hash":"+p15YuVWBh2tPiMKATiE3fzUudMViAA0Hk81rsiqvkM="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
