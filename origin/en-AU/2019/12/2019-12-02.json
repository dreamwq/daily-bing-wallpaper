Yes, today we visit Whitehaven beach - a Queensland beauty covered with some of the purest white silica sand in the world. Found on Whitsunday Island - the largest of the 74 islands in the Whitsundays region – the beach is spread over seven kilometres. That gives tourists and visitors plenty of space to indulge in a wide range of activities. Some will swim, while others snorkel, take a hike through the forest or laze about on the sand with a good book. We sure know where we’d rather be right now. Welcome back, summer, we missed you.","date":"Dec 3, 2019","bsTitle":"Summer vibes are back","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191202_WhitehavenBeachQueensland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"27141c22efc0044f93f8939e75b796d4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehavenBeachQueensland_EN-AU5575796516_tmb.jpg","title":"Summer vibes are back","desc":"Can you think of a better way to welcome back summer than exploring one of the country’s most stunning beaches?
