Builders laid the original bridge stone on July 9 at exactly 5:31 AM, coinciding with a precise set of numbers - the palindrome 135797531 - which was believed to bring additional strength to the structure. But the superstition didn’t stop there. The bridge was also constructed in perfect alignment with the tomb of St. Vitus and the setting sun on the equinox.
