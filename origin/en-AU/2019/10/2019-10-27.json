It’s the Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum in central Oregon - a collection of abandoned homestead-era buildings from the area. In the late 19th and early 20th century, people acquired federal lands around here for farms and ranches via the Homestead Acts - a set of laws introduced into the US. But most left within a few years due to the hot, dry summers and extremely cold winters. Today, the buildings are assembled as a ghost town and contain items from that period, including furniture, dishes, and tools. There's also a nearby cemetery which, according to local lore, is haunted by the ghost of rancher and author Reub Long riding his horse.","date":"Oct 28, 2019","bsTitle":"A night on the (ghost) town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191027_FortRockHomestead%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1d9732261f011746d45428f5fad0a8b4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FortRockHomestead_EN-AU5399257673_tmb.jpg","title":"A night on the (ghost) town","desc":"The spooky scene here might look like someplace you'd want to avoid, but it's not likely to scare you - not too much anyway.
