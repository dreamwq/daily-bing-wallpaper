This Moab-based event is a celebration of what the French call painting ‘en plein air,’ or painting outside. Sounds like a fabulous idea to us (and what a view!). The colourful landscape here at Arches National Park is home to the highest density of natural arches in the world - upwards of 2,000 - as well as more pinnacles and dramatically balanced rocks. Combine that with the fiery sunsets, pinyon trees, and splashes of sage and yucca, and we’d say these artists are in for a treat. Lucky for them, October is a pleasant time to visit the harsh, desert landscape.","date":"Oct 11, 2019","bsTitle":"Art in the high desert","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191010_RedRocksArches%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e75dc6a527773e4dbac4a83c0a201247","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRocksArches_EN-AU7685657832_tmb.jpg","title":"Art in the high desert","desc":"The desert doubles as an art studio this week at Utah’s Arches National Park, as painters from all over congregate for the Red Rock Art…","hash":"+H8HL+us1NKkrYdLmgXfsKVIsYFp8axWUd9U5BJA9Ek="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
