The island, off the coast of southeastern Africa, is the native home to lemurs. Today you'll find over 100 species and subspecies of the critters here. Most are small, with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail. They mainly live in trees and can be highly social, like the ring-tailed lemurs on our homepage, or live a solo existence like the elusive aye-aye. Lemurs have opposable thumbs and five fingers with fingernails on each hand, a characteristic that helps secure their spot as a member of the primate order of mammals.","date":"Oct 25, 2019","bsTitle":"The lemurs of Madagascar","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191024_WorldLemurDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7fc58473a0fd0ef4da0daea485e3cbca","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WorldLemurDay_EN-AU2648519492_tmb.jpg","title":"The lemurs of Madagascar","desc":"What better place to ring in World Lemur Day than Madagascar?
