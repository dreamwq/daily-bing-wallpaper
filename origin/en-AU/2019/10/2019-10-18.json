The annual event displays enormous champion pumpkins weighing over 450 kilograms, hosts live pumpkin carving demonstrations, and offers every kind of pumpkin-related food you can imagine, from pies to pumpkin-flavoured artisanal cocktails. Plus, Gourdy, the anthropomorphised pumpkin mascot. While California is the leader in the consumer pumpkin harvest, it is only the second-largest producer in the country. Illinois grows approximately a quarter of the one billion kilos of pumpkins the US produces yearly, though 80 per cent of that ends up as pie filling or other processed products. Pumpkins require between 90 - 120 days to mature, so most are planted by late May or early June to coincide with Halloween carving needs.","date":"Oct 19, 2019","bsTitle":"The height of pumpkin season","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191018_HalfMoonBayPumpkin%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dfda26109562d73c23c1cb28431e9554","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-AU1036284567_tmb.jpg","title":"The height of pumpkin season","desc":"If you happen to be travelling around California’s Bay Area this weekend, you might want to swing by the Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin…","hash":"P5V7CfEJy102QwslIij5mj1heBpGaNPufExI1tmbSlU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
