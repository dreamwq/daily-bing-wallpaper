Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire round-trip route clocks in at about 19,312 kilometres, making grey whales among the longest migrators of the animal kingdom. Because they travel close to the coastline, it's also one of the few whale migrations you can see from shore.","date":"Mar 26, 2020","bsTitle":"Grey days ahead in Monterey","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200325_NoCaliCoast%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"88bb5bc7d18a0a77021ba8eec42da1d5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NoCaliCoast_EN-AU1168169819_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey days ahead in Monterey","desc":"In late winter and early spring in California's Big Sur, thousands of grey whales, many with calves in tow, swim by this part of the Pacific…","hash":"ICIaB/gTXAmhP40s9SW50kErmEC1FXWMNJgyaXV7FUU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
