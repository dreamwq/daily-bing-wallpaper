This day was chosen since today’s date (March 14) expressed numerically (in US format) matches the number’s first digits, 3.14. Pi represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. It can be used to compute the area and circumference of a circle, such as the circles that make up the bridge we're looking at here in Copenhagen. (Who said maths wasn't useful in the real world?) Many towns, schools, and museums mark the day with festivities based around mathematics and, of course, serving pie. We can’t think of a more delicious way to study geometry.","date":"Mar 14, 2020","bsTitle":"A circular celebration","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200313_Cirkelbroen%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ce5440f096a4b78a7f70e078177c1392","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Cirkelbroen_EN-AU3069546327_tmb.jpg","title":"A circular celebration","desc":"It’s Pi Day, the day we celebrate the mathematical constant π.
