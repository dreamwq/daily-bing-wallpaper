If you're a Star Wars fan you might recognise it as the planet of Crait, featured in 'The Last Jedi'. In reality it's Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, found in southwest Bolivia. This otherworldly landscape is near the crest of the Andes, nearly 3,600 metres above sea level. It was formed by the transformations of prehistoric lakes which dried up in this area, leaving behind a salt crust around a metre deep.
