Commonly found in the Rocky Mountains, limber pines are known to stand the test of time - literally. Some people estimate Old Patriarch to be more than a thousand years old. The 'Cathedral Group' of the Teton Mountains forms a breathtaking backdrop, bursting up from the valley floor below and stretching dramatically to the soaring peaks. The park spreads out below the spires for 125,452 hectares, creating a home for extraordinary wildlife, pristine lakes, and alpine terrain. Sounds like the Old Patriarch has found quite a home for himself.","date":"May 16, 2020","bsTitle":"A tree amid the Tetons","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200515_OldPatriarchTree%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7932e0abd5ff61dcad139f6200e46f67","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-AU4661318212_tmb.jpg","title":"A tree amid the Tetons","desc":"This limber pine standing alone in the sage brush flats of America’s Grand Teton National Park has a name - Old Patriarch.
