The rainbow shown here is at Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Scottish explorer David Livingstone named it in honour of Queen Victoria, although it's also known as its indigenous Lozi language name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means 'the smoke that thunders'. According to some records, local villagers described the falls to Livingstone as 'Seongo' or 'Chongwe', which means 'the place of the rainbow', because rainbows appear in the waterfall's spray. Under a bright moon, you might also see a 'moonbow' here.","date":"Apr 3, 2020","bsTitle":"Follow the rainbow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200402_PlaceofRainbows%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"682efa1878aa8c4166b77e6de1c27975","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-AU6773565889_tmb.jpg","title":"Follow the rainbow","desc":"April showers bring rainbows, and on April 3, the celebration of Find a Rainbow Day.
