This eye-catching piece is made from a hexagonal wooden-framed tube, lined on the inside with reflective acrylic and capped on one end with a projection screen. When a viewer steps inside, the mirrored surfaces reflect their image along with a video projected on the screen, merging the two into a mind-bending mirage. We're stepping inside Fata Morgana for World Art Day. The International Association of Art (IAA) kicked off the idea of World Art Day in 2012, picking the birthday of Leonardo da Vinci, April 15, for the festivities. The occasion has since been recognised by UNESCO as a ‘means to achieve a more developed, free and peaceful world'.","date":"Apr 15, 2020","bsTitle":"Art and soul","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200414_FataMorgana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"608e5751ed1ad6c3a4a90c707342305c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FataMorgana_EN-AU9519130350_tmb.jpg","title":"Art and soul","desc":"This kaleidoscopic creation is the work of Irish artist Laura Buckley, pictured posing here (and there, and there, and there…) with her…","hash":"mpOzrwQDvKCRWBK29qtpiMMG9v7SIVdTIMxn5OL3NYA="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
