Most penguins slide over the ice on their bellies, but these small penguins opt for more aerobic locomotion - they hop. Of all penguin species, rockhoppers are among the most numerous. But pollution, overfishing, and climate change have taken a toll: their population has declined by about 30 per cent over the last 30 years. Today, there's an estimated 1.5 million breeding pairs of rockhoppers. About a million of those are southern rockhopper couples, like these, with the northern and eastern subspecies filling out the rest of numbers.","date":"Apr 26, 2020","bsTitle":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200425_FalklandRockhoppers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3d638382e9a41fe6d3a9811747184d2b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-AU5891260610_tmb.jpg","title":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","desc":"Today we're featuring a jaunty group of southern rockhopper penguins on a Falkland Islands beach.
