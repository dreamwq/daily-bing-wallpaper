The oldest national park east of the Mississippi River and the only one in Maine, Acadia packs a lot of geographical variety into its relatively small size. You'll find kilometres of craggy coastline like the shore in our homepage image, woodlands, wetlands, and mountains. The park's Cadillac Mountain is the highest point along the North Atlantic seaboard and a great spot to take in the sunrise.","date":"Feb 26, 2020","bsTitle":"'The Crown Jewel of the North Atlantic'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200225_AcadiaSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3cea4f1364a9c40596824745d7af15aa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AcadiaSunrise_EN-AU9162005091_tmb.jpg","title":"'The Crown Jewel of the North Atlantic'","desc":"Welcome to Acadia National Park on the US state of Maine's rocky, scenic coast.
