The cherries take several months to mature. As they ripen, they change colour from bright green to dark red. The dark red cherries are perfect for picking. Once the cherries are picked, the fruit surrounding the seeds (or ‘beans’) is removed, then the beans are cleaned and eventually roasted. Colombian coffee is regarded as some of the best in the world.","date":"Oct 1, 2019","bsTitle":"It’s Coffee Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190930_CoffeeCherries%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"acdc0d8e72eafe1ff445d561ef6be5ea","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoffeeCherries_EN-IN3808004453_tmb.jpg","title":"It's Coffee Day","desc":"These coffee cherries are from Colombia’s ‘Coffee Triangle,’ where coffee trees flourish among some of the tallest palm trees you may ever…","hash":"L9T+hlPcnjtCpzWlgTImtrzmukHbsUTwmZsQlRCH3OI="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
