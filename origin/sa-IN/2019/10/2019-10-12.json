The fossil dates back to the Carboniferous period, roughly 350 million years ago. This is a ‘compression fossil’—where a small amount of the original plant material was retained with the mineral deposits that help form the impression. Why all the paleobotany talk? It’s National Fossil Day in the US, a day that was established to promote the value of fossils - and we’re excited! Whether you make a trip to your local natural history museum, trek off to a national park with a fossil exhibit, or just look at fossil photos on the web, we hope you find a fun way to celebrate the day with us.","date":"Oct 13, 2019","bsTitle":"Paleontology meets art","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191012_CompressionFossil%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"55f2269a7611e9689a2e35323d39a8fb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CompressionFossil_EN-IN7288825779_tmb.jpg","title":"Paleontology meets art","desc":"Though it looks like a fresco from Ancient Greece, this is the fossilised remains of a fern found in Córdoba, Spain.
