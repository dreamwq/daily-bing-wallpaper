It was here in Ashdown Forest, in East Sussex, that author A A Milne was inspired by his son Christopher Robin’s own adventures with his soft toys. The forest, which sits on the highest ridge of the beautiful High Weald landscape, includes a real-life Five Hundred Acre Wood as well as other spots that fans will recognise from the books.","date":"Oct 21, 2019","bsTitle":"A forest with stories to tell","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191020_MistyAshdown%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3afa7764f829f3f88d6206af10873b09","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MistyAshdown_EN-IN2333738960_tmb.jpg","title":"A forest with stories to tell","desc":"If this misty wilderness looks a little familiar, it might be because it was the inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood - the home of Winnie…","hash":"Lv6FYOCWAADodgSynvuVGFx/pNRgRhcb2N8VWdVJbtw="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
