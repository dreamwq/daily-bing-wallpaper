Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire roundtrip route clocks in at about 20,000 kilometres, making grey whales among the longest migrators of animal kingdom. Because they travel close to the coastline, it's also one of the few whale migrations you can see from shore.","date":"Mar 26, 2020","bsTitle":"Grey days ahead","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200325_NoCaliCoast%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"197b7dde962cc1e7b5093b32987525b5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NoCaliCoast_EN-IN6713610410_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey days ahead","desc":"In late winter and early spring, thousands of grey whales, many with calves in tow, swim by this part of the Pacific coast as they migrate…","hash":"mzO0hiHHAZYpSKp+uPeZ6k+bG5YjEIPwFMBJedPhP30="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
