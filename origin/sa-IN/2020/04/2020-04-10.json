As their name would suggest, pantropical spotted dolphins live in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They're the second-most common dolphin after the bottlenose and grow between 6 and 7 feet long. That may seem big if you were swimming next to one, but it's really pretty small compared with the big kahuna of the dolphin family—the orca. Orca bulls can be up to 32 feet long and tip the scales at 11 tons. Let's all take a moment today to spread the love of all living creatures big and small, and their importance to our ecosystem.
