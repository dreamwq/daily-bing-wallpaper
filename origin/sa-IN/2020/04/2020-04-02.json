The rainbow shown here is at Victoria Falls in southern Africa on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Scottish explorer David Livingstone named the falls in honour of Britain's Queen Victoria, though it's also still called by its indigenous Lozi language name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means 'the smoke that thunders.' According to some historical records, local villagers described the falls to Livingstone as 'Seongo' or 'Chongwe,' which means 'The Place of the Rainbow,' since rainbows usually appear in the fall's constant spray. Under a bright moon, the falls will produce a 'moonbow.'","date":"Apr 3, 2020","bsTitle":"The rainbow connection","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200402_PlaceofRainbows%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e905014ebcc8bc575c5aa004ff9e5211","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-IN0867581399_tmb.jpg","title":"The rainbow connection","desc":"April showers bring rainbows, and on April 3, the celebration of Find a Rainbow Day.
