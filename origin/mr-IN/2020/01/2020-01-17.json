The terminus was opened to public in 1882, designed in its gothic style by FW Stevens for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.  Stone friezes, flying buttresses and these stained-glass windows are iconic elements of the design. Next time your’e at VT, don’t forget to look up – some of these design elements are so high up, they can only be seen from the eye level of the upper deck of a double decker bus.","date":"Jan 18, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200117_WindowVT%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c6808478bfe6d204febc100bd53e6833","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WindowVT_EN-IN7393118797_tmb.jpg","title":"Stained-glass windows at VT station, Mumbai","desc":"The stained-glass window that you see on today’s homepage is from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, in Mumbai, earlier known…","hash":"AdopI9cI1aaW0dIXV+K97N9le0iylXy8TaSP0wwne54="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"लोड करत आहे...","previous":"मागील प्रतिमा","next":"पुढील प्रतिमा","walle":"ही प्रतिमा वॉलपेपर म्हणून डाउनलोड करण्यास उपलब्ध नाही.","walls":"ही प्रतिमा डाउनलोड करा. या प्रतिमेचा वापर केवळ वॉलपेपरसाठी निर्बंधित आहे."}}
