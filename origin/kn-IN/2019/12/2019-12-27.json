Depending on where they live, these swans are either resident birds or medium-range migrators. What they all require, though, is open water during winter, since their diet consists almost entirely of aquatic plants. That may be why the swans in this image are drawn to the waters of Kelly Warm Springs in Wyoming (mountain region, Western United States), which won't freeze even as snow lines the banks.","date":"Dec 28, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191227_TrumpeterWinter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b90949fc3cccba438fe69b9d03f1d3c5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-IN5919289040_tmb.jpg","title":"Did they forget to migrate this winter?","desc":"Native to North America, trumpeter swans live near rivers, lakes, and coastal byways in most parts of the United States and Canada…","hash":"owGO7O5rI7a8x+5TCbt//cK8I/Z8tMnJStK0eJRITQA="}},{"startdate":"20191226","fullstartdate":"201912261830","enddate":"20191227","url":"/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-IN4569312914_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-IN4569312914","copyright":"Skating on a frozen canal near the windmills at Kinderdijk in the Netherlands (© Lourens Smak/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=kinderdijk+windmills&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191226_1830%22","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","caption":"'Winterpret' on ice","copyrightonly":"© Lourens Smak/Alamy","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk are embracing 'winterpret,' a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter fun.' Whenever temperatures drop low enough, many locals take to the ice and skate away on a complex network of canals. These waterways were built centuries ago—along with pumps, dykes, and the windmills pictured here—to protect the village of Kinderdijk by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem. Nowadays a modern water management system with multiple pumping stations does the work, and the windmills are left with a new job–to maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.","date":"Dec 27, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191226_KinderdijkSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"649b803024df990ee0e5742bd7ad52d1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-IN4569312914_tmb.jpg","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk are embracing 'winterpret,' a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter fun.'
