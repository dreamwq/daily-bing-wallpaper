Each year the count runs from December 14 to January 5, giving bird lovers across North America a chance to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The findings recorded by participants are collected and used to gauge the health of various bird populations. This information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas.","date":"Dec 14, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191213_SpruceGrouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7304bdf7606b616b0dcc242828433417","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505_tmb.jpg","title":"American Bird Count begins","desc":"Today marks the start of the annual Christmas Bird Count, a bird census sponsored by the National Audubon Society (a US-based non-profit…","hash":"ZfpUOf6dHm9c6nh0sYPCL+F0zTQavJbAsntLvNuUcKc="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದೆ...","previous":"ಹಿಂದಿನ ಇಮೇಜ್‌","next":"ಮುಂದಿನ ಇಮೇಜ್","walle":"ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್ ವಾಲ್‌ಪೇಪರ್ ಆಗಿ ಡೌನ್‌ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಲಭ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ.","walls":"ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್ ಡೌನ್‌ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡಿ. ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್‌ನ ಬಳಕೆ ಕೇವಲ ವಾಲ್‌ಪೇಪರ್‌ಗೆ ನಿರ್ಬಂಧಿತವಾಗಿದೆ."}}
