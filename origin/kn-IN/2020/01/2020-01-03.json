At Sensorio, a new arts centre that bills itself as representing 'the intersection of art, technology and nature,' visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibres, that change colour. When the sun sets, the fibres illuminate, creating a shimmering, interactive landscape in the meadow.
