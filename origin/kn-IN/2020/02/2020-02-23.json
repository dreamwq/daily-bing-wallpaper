Losar is celebrated for 15 days, but most events occur in the first three days. They include wishing family members a prosperous year, praying at monasteries or temples, exchanging gifts, burning incense, chanting, wrestling, horse racing, and more. Celebrations for the new year end with Chotrul Duchen, or the Butter Lamp Festival. The pilgrims in today's image are releasing prayer flags called 'wind horses' or lungtas, a ritual they perform during Losar and during the rest of the year as well. Upon releasing the prayer flags, the pilgrims ask the mountain deity to 'increase their fortune like the galloping of a horse and expand their prosperity like the boiling over of milk.'","date":"Feb 24, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200223_Windhorses%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cbaaa6301a61c33f9a8518941742c45f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Windhorses_EN-IN2798869736_tmb.jpg","title":"Wind horses carry wishes for a new year","desc":"For the first day of Losar, or the Tibetan New Year, we're paying a visit to these Buddhist pilgrims at the Ganden Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet…","hash":"73v2cX0YJNLCi34B1x6tom7U7YsGFIwYHo0VQyeJ9nQ="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿದೆ...","previous":"ಹಿಂದಿನ ಇಮೇಜ್‌","next":"ಮುಂದಿನ ಇಮೇಜ್","walle":"ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್ ವಾಲ್‌ಪೇಪರ್ ಆಗಿ ಡೌನ್‌ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡಲು ಲಭ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲ.","walls":"ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್ ಡೌನ್‌ಲೋಡ್ ಮಾಡಿ. ಈ ಇಮೇಜ್‌ನ ಬಳಕೆ ಕೇವಲ ವಾಲ್‌ಪೇಪರ್‌ಗೆ ನಿರ್ಬಂಧಿತವಾಗಿದೆ."}}
