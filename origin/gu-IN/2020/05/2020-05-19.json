These hard-working insects are key pollinators of flowers, like the nectar-rich lavender seen growing here. Bees are also critical for the pollination of fruits and vegetables—about a third of the food we eat is a result of honeybee pollination. In the US, honeybees, whether tended by beekeepers or living in the wild, pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops every year. That's a lot of gold—and doesn't even include their delicious honey. So today, on World Bee Day, we invite you to stop and smell the flowers and give a nod to the bees that help colour our world.","date":"May 20, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200519_LavenderBee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"79c4df19d92309a2cbefd0ec0f2b803c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-IN1864200207_tmb.jpg","title":"It's World Bee Day","desc":"Today we've buzzed to Provence, France, to enjoy this scenic view brought to you by bees.
