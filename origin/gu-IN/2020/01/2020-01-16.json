While seabirds like the cormorant are a threat to these fish, the mackerel aren't exactly defenseless. Fish have many unique means of defence, such as travelling in dense schools like this one. It's a technique that not only allows for speedy travel (because it reduces friction on most of the fish in the school)–schooling also makes it more difficult for predators to pick out an individual victim. For these fish, there's safety in numbers. But when all else fails, they can take some advice from Dory in 'Finding Nemo'—'Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.'","date":"Jan 17, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200116_CormorantMackerel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9d93df0f0a87ff962ef268c4fcee1089","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CormorantMackerel_EN-IN3603309183_tmb.jpg","title":"A seabird gets ‘schooled'","desc":"This deep-diving Brandt’s cormorant appears to be on the hunt for a meal, and there’s plenty of Pacific mackerel to choose from here off the…","hash":"r2cBMttJ62Ui4z5Y0d6xmlAO4a1cxpUF9KRcTaMDt0Y="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"લોડ થઈ રહ્યું છે...","previous":"અગાઉની ઇમેજ","next":"આગલી ઇમેજ","walle":"આ છબી વૉલપેપર તરીકે ડાઉનલોડ કરવા માટે ઉપલબ્ધ નથી.","walls":"આ ઇમેજ ડાઉનલોડ કરો. આ ઇમેજનો ઉપયોગ ફક્ત વૉલપેપર સુધી મર્યાદિત છે."}}
