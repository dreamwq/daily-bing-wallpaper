Since 2000, this exhibit, created by artist Clara Halter and architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, has been inspiring visitors to write their own messages of peace and place them in gaps intentionally created in the structure for that purpose. To mark International Day of Peace, hundreds of events around the world are being held today, including peace fairs, music concerts, meditations, and more. The UN declared it a 'day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples.' One of the events today is at the UN Headquarters in New York, where the Secretary-General will ring the Peace Bell and participants will observe a minute of silence.","date":"Sep 21, 2019","bsTitle":"'The Wall for Peace'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190921_WallofPeace%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6bb6f01cd81cfb7110513929ed46954a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WallofPeace_EN-CA2850618972_tmb.jpg","title":"'The Wall for Peace'","desc":"In today's image, we're featuring 'The Wall for Peace' in Paris for the International Day of Peace.

If you have a taste palette for wine, you can identify the use of the Gewürztraminer grape by its low acidity, wholesome texture and fruity flavours like peach, apricot and mango. A major characteristic is its sweet scent similar to lychee, grapefruit and rose petals.
