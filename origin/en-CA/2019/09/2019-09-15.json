Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above.

Together they cover more than 20,000 square kilometres, with the East park consisting of flat, dry plains, and the West including mountains, volcanoes, lakes, and springs. The gerenuk (which means giraffe-necked antelope in Somali) is a long-necked antelope also known as the giraffe gazelle. It uses its lengthy neck and ability to stand on its hind legs to nibble on shrubs and trees that other types of antelope can't reach. It's less social then other gazelles, so seeing one alone, as we are in this photo, is common.","date":"Sep 10, 2019","bsTitle":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190910_TsavoGerenuk%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30ef778236de4eb6747b0c4a37958437","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TsavoGerenuk_EN-CA3021763596_tmb.jpg","title":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","desc":"It's peak tourist season in the Tsavo region of Kenya, when the weather's cooler and dry—a good time to spot wildlife like this gerenuk in…","hash":"ftHK+FLlEVYqXkUXV1yozJ54wF5+MIB7P9WBJCFpl2M="}},{"startdate":"20190909","fullstartdate":"201909090400","enddate":"20190910","url":"/th?id=OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522","copyright":"Tegallalang terrace farms in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia (© gorgeoussab/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ubud%2c+Bali&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190909_0400%22","title":"A lush, green escape","caption":"A lush, green escape","copyrightonly":"© gorgeoussab/Shutterstock","desc":"With the tourist season winding down and rainy season still forthcoming, September is an ideal time to visit Bali.

The irrigation system here, known as Subak, is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. Water flows through temples and into the rice paddies, carved into the hillsides like steps. It's a tradition that dates back thousands of years, based on the Balinese philosophical principle of Tri Hita Karana, which refers to a relationship between humans, the earth, and the gods.","date":"Sep 9, 2019","bsTitle":"A lush, green escape","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190909_Tegallalang%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dacd5399567473676f840df9da117963","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522_tmb.jpg","title":"A lush, green escape","desc":"With the tourist season winding down and rainy season still forthcoming, September is an ideal time to visit Bali.
