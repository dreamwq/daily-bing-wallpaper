The event was established in 2012 to encourage acts of generosity during the holidays, when consumerism seems to be the focus for so many. Giving Tuesday was started by a small nonprofit on the East Coast and with the help of social media campaigns, it's grown into a global movement. In 2018, Giving Tuesday participants raised over $15 million across the country. Of course, you don't have to give money to participate. Organizers urge folks to volunteer or take a cue from our homepage puffins, and simply show kindness to one another. Now that's something we can all get behind (seabirds included).","date":"Dec 3, 2019","bsTitle":"It’s Giving Tuesday","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191203_PuffinSharing%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"895e2777e44042b455fc51203c402f06","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PuffinSharing_EN-CA4763163478_tmb.jpg","title":"It's Giving Tuesday","desc":"By gifting his mate some prime nesting materials, we think this gentlemanly Atlantic puffin makes a fine mascot for Giving Tuesday, which is…","hash":"l2KV2OpbBW/C4fQeX8iidVE2cdzPcl6dtnJHoVP5wjg="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
