This year marks the 22nd edition and has earned the reputation of being the most popular Christmas attraction in western Canada. Visitors can get tickets to ride a miniature train that features live performances with a spectacular display of lights along the route. To keep yourself cozy, we highly recommend getting a hot chocolate before boarding the train.","date":"Dec 7, 2019","bsTitle":"Bright Nights display at Stanley Park","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191207_NutcrackerStanley%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e767311ae28c3a50e6877933341acd56","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerStanley_EN-CA9840887346_tmb.jpg","title":"Bright Nights display at Stanley Park","desc":"If you’re looking to indulge in some festive fun, Vancouver’s Bright Nights Train event at Stanley Park is taking place between Nov. 28th…","hash":"ur+WT0zVEkuO5oTjKVtYPUo5iedoAHpReBWy1bt0wqg="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
