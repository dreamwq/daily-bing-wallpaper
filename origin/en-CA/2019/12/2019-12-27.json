Whenever temps drop low enough, many locals take to the ice and skate away on a complex network of canals. These waterways were built centuries ago—along with pumps, dykes, and the windmills pictured here—to protect the village of Kinderdijk by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem. Nowadays a modern water management system with multiple pumping stations does the work, and the windmills are left with a new job–to maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.","date":"Dec 27, 2019","bsTitle":"'Winterpret' on ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191227_KinderdijkSkating%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"8c1ac61aee8b450c6fa15ca59a1bf501","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KinderdijkSkating_EN-CA7067411582_tmb.jpg","title":"'Winterpret' on ice","desc":"These skaters in the village of Kinderdijk are embracing 'winterpret,' a Dutch word that means 'winter joy' or 'winter fun.'

Until the advent of macro- and micro-photography in the late 1800s, it was impossible to study the structure of snowflakes—they melted too quickly to be accurately sketched under a microscope. Enter Wilson 'Snowflake' Bentley. A farmer and self-trained scientist from Jericho, Vermont, Bentley was the first person to successfully photograph an individual snowflake. Over his lifetime, he would produce over 5,000 different images, a feat that led him to be the first to observe that every snowflake is unique. He backed up his observation with some math and meteorology as well. He understood that snowflakes form as they fall through the sky, and their growth and appearance are shaped by hundreds of changing conditions, from altitude, temperature, humidity, and more. The combinations multiply exponentially until there are more design possibilities than mol","date":"Dec 22, 2019","bsTitle":"You’ve never seen anything like this","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191222_RealSnowflake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8788c16e212884ec0fcf6bcaacea7b65","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RealSnowflake_EN-CA6730238530_tmb.jpg","title":"You've never seen anything like this","desc":"This macrophotograph of a snowflake shows the classic, six-sided structure that we’ve all come to associate with this tiny winter marvel…","hash":"S5itZxJL1mn+GjWo567SykeGd+dGTjU+pN+Ra4vJdu4="}},{"startdate":"20191221","fullstartdate":"201912210500","enddate":"20191222","url":"/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-CA6652948362_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-CA6652948362","copyright":"The Seventeen-Arch Bridge over Kunming Lake in Beijing Summer Palace, China (© Jia Wang/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=beijing+summer+palace&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191221_0500%22","title":"Seventeen arches at sunset","caption":"Seventeen arches at sunset","copyrightonly":"© Jia Wang/Getty Images","desc":"When it's winter solstice time in the Northern Hemisphere, the setting sun shines under the Seventeen-Arch Bridge of the Summer Palace in Beijing, causing this romantic glow.
