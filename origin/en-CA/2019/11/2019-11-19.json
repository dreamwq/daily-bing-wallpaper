Fewer than 2,000 people visited back in 1919 due to poor road conditions and lack of trails. These days, the park has the opposite problem—with more than 4 million people coming each year, crowds create long lines for shuttles and clog popular areas such as the Narrows. Part of Zion Canyon, the Narrows can be seen from a paved path. But many people like to experience it up close, hiking in the Virgin River, and it can get crowded at peak times since it's—as the name implies—narrow.","date":"Nov 19, 2019","bsTitle":"Zion National Park Turns 100","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191119_ZionBirthday%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6c1673a8e6e11da6c3bae1989caafb88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZionBirthday_EN-CA0839645590_tmb.jpg","title":"Zion National Park Turns 100","desc":"It's been exactly 100 years since U.S.President Woodrow Wilson signed an act to convert Mukuntuweap National Monument into Zion National…","hash":"zC7y32Gyyt2AoRuWon4KGpTsG1siJ9rnwkSBVOTgUTo="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
