Despite the extreme winters here, this bird can be found year-round across mountain and boreal forests. They are capable of nesting as early as February, amidst frigid temperatures and snowstorms. Since gray jays rarely migrate to lower elevations and tend to stay put in one place, they do not face the challenges of annual migrations. Thus, this omnivorous bird tends to have a long lifespan for a small bird.","date":"Nov 27, 2019","bsTitle":"Fearless and venturesome","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191127_GrayJayBranch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d79b47eede57c4ae55aa1be2d3ca673c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GrayJayBranch_EN-CA7590099063_tmb.jpg","title":"Fearless and venturesome","desc":"Found in every province and territory, the gray jay is a member of the corvid family.
