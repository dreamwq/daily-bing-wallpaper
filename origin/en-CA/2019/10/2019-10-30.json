Builders laid the original bridge stone on July 9 at exactly 5:31 AM, coinciding with a precise set of numbers—the palindrome 135797531—which was believed to bring additional strength to the structure. But the superstition didn’t stop there. The bridge was also constructed in perfect alignment with the tomb of St. Vitus and the setting sun on the equinox. A more recent superstition involves the statue of the revered Saint John of Nepomuk that stands on the bridge—according to folklore, rubbing the plaque at the base of the statue will grant you a wish. Throughout history, the legendary bridge has undergone a multitude of catastrophes, from fighting to flooding. These days, however, it’s one of Prague’s most visited sites. Whether that’s because of its superstitious strength or not—that’s up to you to decide.","date":"Oct 30, 2019","bsTitle":"Cross this bridge if you dare","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191030_CharlesNight%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"07f65903eb63394648b2a6e741c3a23b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CharlesNight_EN-CA2355782484_tmb.jpg","title":"Cross this bridge if you dare","desc":"Superstition abounds on the Charles Bridge, dating back to its construction in 1357.
