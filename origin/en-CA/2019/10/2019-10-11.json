This Moab-based event is a celebration of what the French call painting ‘en plein air,’ or painting outside. Sounds like a fabulous idea to us (and what a view!). The colourful landscape here at Arches National Park is home to the highest density of natural arches in the world—upwards of 2,000—as well as more pinnacles and dramatically balanced rocks. Combine that with the fiery sunsets, pinyon trees, and splashes of sage and yucca, and we’d say these artists are in for a treat. Lucky for them, October is a pleasant time to visit the harsh, desert landscape.","date":"Oct 11, 2019","bsTitle":"Art in the high desert","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191011_RedRocksArches%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"083c83c9de1878cc7e3b6e067a297912","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRocksArches_EN-CA3507725233_tmb.jpg","title":"Art in the high desert","desc":"The desert doubles as an art studio this week at Arches National Park, as painters from all over congregate for the Red Rock Art Festival…","hash":"/PhygV41DW05vkaaOl94Bz87ALE/IhHXZY0X7y/hI9s="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
