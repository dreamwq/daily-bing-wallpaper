It's Shakespeare Week in schools across the U.K., so we're field-tripping to the British Library for a peek at the only surviving specimen of what's thought to be playwright William Shakespeare's handwriting (if you don't count legal documents).

In 1603, the censorious royal Office of the Revels brought in Shakespeare among a team of writers to retool the script.
