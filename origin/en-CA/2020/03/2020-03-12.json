The hoodoo rocks pictured here, are a result of millions of years’ worth of erosion caused by a combination of water, wind and frost. They typically stand at least five metres tall and are sculpted in layers of sandstone and shale. The top of these rocks have a harder rock (capstone) which protects the units below.
