This tiny region in the Province of Cáceres, Spain, has the perfect microclimate for cherry trees, and there are more than 1.5 million of them here in just 60 square kilometres. The cherry blossoms last just two weeks before the petals rain down, covering the entire valley. About 40 days later, the first cherries are ready to be picked.

Cherries are also used for spa and beauty treatments, since they have antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to vitamins and ellagic acid.","date":"Mar 13, 2020","bsTitle":"Jerte Valley in bloom","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200313_JerteCherries%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4877a0decc042b3b2752eeac4fc74652","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JerteCherries_EN-CA4876383388_tmb.jpg","title":"Jerte Valley in bloom","desc":"As winter turns to spring in the Jerte Valley, all eyes are on the cherry blossoms.
