Titled 'Field of Light,' it's currently on display at a venue called Sensorio in Paso Robles, California, the latest stop in a tour of sites around the world. At Sensorio, a new arts centere that bills itself as representing 'the intersection of art, technology and nature,' visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibers, that change colour. When the sun sets, the fibers illuminate, creating a shimmering, interactive landscape in the meadow. The art installation changes a bit at each destination, but Munro tells reporters, 'the one constant is that it does make people smile.'","date":"Jan 3, 2020","bsTitle":"'Field of Light at Sensorio' by Bruce Munro","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200103_MunroLight%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"7ba47661a3dc1a833fcfbd2a73dfaa4c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-CA4746295930_tmb.jpg","title":"'Field of Light at Sensorio' by Bruce Munro","desc":"Artist Bruce Munro was camping at Ayers Rock in Australia with his family in 1992 when he envisioned the art installation on today's…","hash":"g8AEMj/bRpgbYTKh7pZFVg4fRAk7O0gkbPsPcIm9Bsk="}},{"startdate":"20200102","fullstartdate":"202001020500","enddate":"20200103","url":"/th?id=OHR.WhirlpoolFinland_EN-CA7828394960_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WhirlpoolFinland_EN-CA7828394960","copyright":"The whirlpool in Myllykoski scenic area at winter in Oulanka National Park, Kuusamo, Finland (© Lassi Rautiainen/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=oulanka+national+park+finland&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200102_0500%22","title":"Winter in the Finnish wilds","caption":"Winter in the Finnish wilds","copyrightonly":"© Lassi Rautiainen/Minden Pictures","desc":"Don't be fooled by this frozen scene's tranquility.
