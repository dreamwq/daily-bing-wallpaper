Shortly thereafter, it began its continuing mission to capture images of our universe from low Earth orbit, free of the obstructions of clouds and the distortions of the atmosphere. Like its namesake, the great astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope has transformed our understanding of the cosmos. Some of the telescope's greatest contributions include its Deep Field Images—which peer back billions of lightyears—or its with jaw-dropping images of objects closer to home, like the one on today’s homepage, which shows a maelstrom of glowing gas and dark dust within one of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud.","date":"Apr 24, 2020","bsTitle":"Celebrating 30 years of eye-opening images","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200424_MegellanicCloud%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"55f4d092bf9366f946bfece1b0a01c32","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MegellanicCloud_EN-CA6994317408_tmb.jpg","title":"Celebrating 30 years of eye-opening images","desc":"On this day in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope entered orbit in the cargo bay of the space shuttle Discovery.
