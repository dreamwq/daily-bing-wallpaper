This giant kauri tree lives in the Waipou Rainforest of New Zealand’s North Island. At more than 1,500 years old and more than 15 metres around, it’s both one of the oldest trees in New Zealand and one of the largest. It's long been revered by the Maori, and is protected by Maori elders. We suspect this ancient tree must have some extra bounce in its branches today for the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.","date":"Apr 22, 2020","bsTitle":"50 years of Earth Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200422_KauriTree%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b72b6af2fd2e6cfb3132640db4b547a2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KauriTree_EN-CA9653054615_tmb.jpg","title":"50 years of Earth Day","desc":"For Mother Earth’s big day, we’re shining the spotlight on a tree known as ‘Father of the Forest,’ or Te Matua Ngahere in the Maori language…","hash":"zdXvBNyMDqcu5ag/BcnfOyTOEPevgOKplOODvxIzFDo="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
