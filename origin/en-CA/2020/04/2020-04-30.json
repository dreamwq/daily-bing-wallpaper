This hardy finch spends much of its time, including breeding season, in the brushy tundra of the northern polar regions. Because of the extreme cold, the female will often line her nest with feathers, particularly white ptarmigan feathers, as these appear to be. Sighting a hoary redpoll is a rare treat. The bird doesn't exactly migrate, but in winter it will sometimes fly short distances farther south in search of food. You can recognize a hoary redpoll by its small yellow bill, red cap, dark face, and “frosty” white underbody streaked with brown. Or, listen for the “chif chif chif” of its call.","date":"Apr 30, 2020","bsTitle":"What bird will these eggs become?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200430_ArcticRedpoll%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fbb3c8f76949e6b9bc88d34502a85800","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-CA8077744615_tmb.jpg","title":"What bird will these eggs become?","desc":"These colourful little eggs are the progeny of the hoary redpoll, also known as the Arctic redpoll because of its extreme northern habitat…","hash":"9DugWxErJySt7EnkWAd+Ir9Ke313ilRBz2G0YKSSpxA="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
