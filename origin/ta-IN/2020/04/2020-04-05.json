Shantrunjaya literally means ‘place of victory over inner enemies.’  Located near Palitana city, the hill hosts 865 Jain temples. Why is this hill so important to Jains? It is here that the first tirthankara of Jainism, Rishabha, gave his first sermon. The place also holds significance as Rishabha’s son made a shrine here, and grandson Pundarika Swami is believed to have attained moksha here. Today, the hill stands as a symbol of Jain heritage.","date":"Apr 6, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200405_ShatrunjayaHill%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"95dd4f02bd1b9123e5b36b3420209400","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShatrunjayaHill_EN-IN0445917347_tmb.jpg","title":"The sacred hills of Shatrunjaya","desc":"Today, for Mahavir Jayanti, we take you to the sacred (Jain) hills of Shatrunjaya (originally known as Pundarikgiri) in Gujarat…","hash":"Fdx3wD7M10buXGDKyTrtwwlbhqKewdVZn+lfGsOCmQw="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ஏற்றுகிறது...","previous":"முந்தைய படிமம்","next":"அடுத்த படிமம்","walle":"இந்தப் படிமத்தை வால்பேப்பராக பதிவிறக்க கிடைக்கப்பெறாது.","walls":"இந்த படத்தை பதிவிறக்கவும். வால்பேப்பருக்கு மட்டுமே பயன்படுத்த இந்தப் படம் கட்டுப்படுத்தப்பட்டுள்ளது."}}
