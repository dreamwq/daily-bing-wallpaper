The terminus was opened to public in 1882, designed in its gothic style by FW Stevens for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.  Stone friezes, flying buttresses and these stained-glass windows are iconic elements of the design. Next time your’e at VT, don’t forget to look up – some of these design elements are so high up, they can only be seen from the eye level of the upper deck of a double decker bus.","date":"Jan 18, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200117_WindowVT%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c6808478bfe6d204febc100bd53e6833","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WindowVT_EN-IN7393118797_tmb.jpg","title":"Stained-glass windows at VT station, Mumbai","desc":"The stained-glass window that you see on today’s homepage is from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, in Mumbai, earlier known…","hash":"AdopI9cI1aaW0dIXV+K97N9le0iylXy8TaSP0wwne54="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ஏற்றுகிறது...","previous":"முந்தைய படிமம்","next":"அடுத்த படிமம்","walle":"இந்தப் படிமத்தை வால்பேப்பராக பதிவிறக்க கிடைக்கப்பெறாது.","walls":"இந்த படத்தை பதிவிறக்கவும். வால்பேப்பருக்கு மட்டுமே பயன்படுத்த இந்தப் படம் கட்டுப்படுத்தப்பட்டுள்ளது."}}
