The landforms were created when volcanoes deposited mounds of soft, porous rock called tuff, which was later covered with hard basalt. In the 10th century (though possibly starting up to 5,000 years ago) humans excavated the tuff to create caves and catacombs that could fit thousands of dwellers. Through not only the astonishing ruins but the many 'cave hotels' hewn into rock in the city of Göreme, the memory of those ingenious city planners lives on.","date":"Mar 2, 2020","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20200301_SeussianLandscape%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9f6c4dea8437017d9a7fbae1fb081a02","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeussianLandscape_EN-IN1421773306_tmb.jpg","title":"And to think that I saw it in Cappadocia","desc":"The fantastical 'fairy chimneys' found in central Turkey's historic Cappadocia region were formed by a collision of the natural and the man…","hash":"7IkXbM2K1mqjaRTpeJzPxzXCSpxbRIj1tP9Y5P1ytbk="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ஏற்றுகிறது...","previous":"முந்தைய படிமம்","next":"அடுத்த படிமம்","walle":"இந்தப் படிமத்தை வால்பேப்பராக பதிவிறக்க கிடைக்கப்பெறாது.","walls":"இந்த படத்தை பதிவிறக்கவும். வால்பேப்பருக்கு மட்டுமே பயன்படுத்த இந்தப் படம் கட்டுப்படுத்தப்பட்டுள்ளது."}}
