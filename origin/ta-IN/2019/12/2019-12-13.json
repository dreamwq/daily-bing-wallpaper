Each year the count runs from December 14 to January 5, giving bird lovers across North America a chance to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The findings recorded by participants are collected and used to gauge the health of various bird populations. This information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas.","date":"Dec 14, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191213_SpruceGrouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7304bdf7606b616b0dcc242828433417","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505_tmb.jpg","title":"American Bird Count begins","desc":"Today marks the start of the annual Christmas Bird Count, a bird census sponsored by the National Audubon Society (a US-based non-profit…","hash":"ZfpUOf6dHm9c6nh0sYPCL+F0zTQavJbAsntLvNuUcKc="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"ஏற்றுகிறது...","previous":"முந்தைய படிமம்","next":"அடுத்த படிமம்","walle":"இந்தப் படிமத்தை வால்பேப்பராக பதிவிறக்க கிடைக்கப்பெறாது.","walls":"இந்த படத்தை பதிவிறக்கவும். வால்பேப்பருக்கு மட்டுமே பயன்படுத்த இந்தப் படம் கட்டுப்படுத்தப்பட்டுள்ளது."}}
