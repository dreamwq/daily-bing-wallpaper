Likewise, as the leaves on the Queen Victoria agave in today's image spiral out from the centre, they also express the Fibonacci sequence. This unique sequence of numbers was introduced to Europe in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (posthumously named Fibonacci) in his revolutionary work the 'Liber Abaci.' The book begins by describing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system or 'Modus Indorum’—0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9—showing how their application could simplify trade and make calculations faster and easier (most of Europe at this time used Roman numerals).","date":"Nov 23, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20191122_QueenVictoriaAgave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"645e4d1b79fc16eefce0898bccea0c5d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QueenVictoriaAgave_EN-IN7061304355_tmb.jpg","title":"1, 1, 2, 3: It's Fibonacci Day!","desc":"Today's date, November 23, can be represented as 11/23, or 1,1,2,3—a Fibonacci sequence of numbers.
