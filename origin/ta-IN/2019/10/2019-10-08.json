About 100 kilometres southeast of Buffalo, the 27-kilometre long park protects a stunning section of the Genesee River that cuts through a deep gorge. The cliffs, close to 600-feet high in some places, offer knockout views of several waterfalls and the thick deciduous forest. The historic Glen Iris Inn, once the home and refuge of industrialist William Pryor Letchworth, overlooks Middle Falls. In 1906, Letchworth bequeathed his 1,000-acre estate to the state of New York.
