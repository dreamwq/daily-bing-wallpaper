{"title":"Light up the night","caption":"Celebrating Chile’s Independence Day","desc":"That’s the Villarrica volcano providing fireworks as we mark Chile’s Independence Day, the celebrations  for which take place on 18 and 19 September. One of South America’s most active volcanoes, Villarrica is known to the indigenous Mapuche people as Rucapillán (Devil’s House). This photo was taken on 2 September, 2018, a scene that alarmed nearby residents but wasn’t nearly as destructive as other eruptions - like one in 2015 that prompted the evacuation of thousands of people.","copyright":"The Villarrica volcano in Chile on 2 September, 2018 (© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters)","copyrightonly":"© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters","copyrightlink":"/search?q=villarrica+volcano&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190917_2300%22","date":"20190917","image":{"name":"OHR.Villarrica_EN-GB8545416858.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/92e179ede39751bafed5b7a9f5936ac57c50aadad784311c292b6d5f0a866170.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-GB8545416858_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-GB8545416858_tmb.jpg"}}
