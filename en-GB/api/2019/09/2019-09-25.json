{"title":"A trembling giant","caption":"Autumn at the Pando","desc":"All is not as it appears to be here at the Pando, in Fishlake National Forest, in the US state of Utah. At first glance, visitors may think they are seeing a massive grove of quaking aspen trees, their leaves dancing in the wind. But the Pando is not many trees; instead, it's a single organism. Like many aspen groves, each of the 40,000 trees in the Pando are genetically identical stems that sprout from the same root system. First discovered in 1968, the Pando made waves in the scientific world. It's recognised as one of the heaviest known organisms - believed to weigh 6,000 tonnes - and one of the oldest known living organisms.","copyright":"The Pando, Fishlake National Forest, Utah, USA (Â© Don Paulson/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pando+tree&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190925_2300%22","date":"20190925","image":{"name":"OHR.ThePando_EN-GB8057038733.jpg","hd":"/images/3710FD85D65CBDB71A0E7113220892CBB34D5683B61B0A98B0E6B1E4AD1FC44A.jpg","tmb":"/images/0C1896CBBB956D41AE11D69C919692958D3BE184A3D93F00CB4086814181F6B7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-GB8057038733_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-GB8057038733_tmb.jpg"}}
