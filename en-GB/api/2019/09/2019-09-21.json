{"title":"Let the sparks fly","caption":"Barcelona bids farewell to summer","desc":"Every year, for four days in September, people flock to one of Barcelona’s biggest events, La Mercè Festival. It all dates back to 1687 when Barcelona was suffering from a plague of locusts. In desperation, city officials voted to ask for the assistance of the Virgin of Grace (Mare de Déu de la Mercè). Delivered from the pestilence, the officials named her patroness of Barcelona, and an annual festival has been celebrated in her honour ever since.","copyright":"Fireworks during La Merce Festival in Barcelona, Spain (© Lucas Vallecillos/age fotostock)","copyrightonly":"© Lucas Vallecillos/age fotostock","copyrightlink":"/search?q=barcelona+la+merce&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190921_2300%22","date":"20190921","image":{"name":"OHR.LaMerceFireworks_EN-GB1396376202.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/41b0e303e5019b5655de4d76a9996233607f2ca46c3b945856a8b42772a93be3.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaMerceFireworks_EN-GB1396376202_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaMerceFireworks_EN-GB1396376202_tmb.jpg"}}
