{"title":"Ready for take-off","caption":"A birdwatcher's heaven","desc":"This common loon is spreading its wings in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota, near the US border with Canada. As temperatures cool, the protected area becomes a birdwatcher’s paradise as migrating flocks stop over on their flights south. The huge forest, which has more than 2,000 lakes, offers the right combination of water, woods, and wetlands to support more than 155 species of birds.","copyright":"A common loon in Superior National Forest in Minnesota, USA (© Jim Brandenburg/Minden Pictures)","copyrightonly":"© Jim Brandenburg/Minden Pictures","copyrightlink":"/search?q=common+loon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190918_2300%22","date":"20190918","image":{"name":"OHR.CommonLoon_EN-GB9366166836.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/2823aaa98ae0ec919b3c0492dffaf5148e4f3216b27bf281f7a320719ceac381.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CommonLoon_EN-GB9366166836_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CommonLoon_EN-GB9366166836_tmb.jpg"}}
