For the rest of the time they hang out on ice floes, the males and females huddled separately, taking a break before diving in for more food.

Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above.

Covering around 460 square miles, the forest is said to present one of the most complex ecosystems on our planet.

Together they cover 8,036 square miles, with the East park consisting of flat, dry plains, and the West including mountains, volcanoes, lakes and springs. The gerenuk (which means giraffe-necked antelope in Somali) is a long-necked antelope also known as the giraffe gazelle. It uses its lengthy neck and ability to stand on its hind legs to nibble on shrubs and trees that other types of antelope can't reach. It's less social than other gazelles, so seeing one alone, as we are in this photo, is common.","date":"10 Sep 2019","bsTitle":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190909_TsavoGerenuk%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f214702bb4082bf28cd05545088c48f5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TsavoGerenuk_EN-GB6803472746_tmb.jpg","title":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","desc":"It's peak tourist season in the Tsavo region of Kenya, when the weather's cooler and dry – a good time to spot wildlife like this gerenuk in…","hash":"m7PB+PniCdpaWb5w7hNkaJOHGlzKpGfIDWWizg9SZM0="}},{"startdate":"20190908","fullstartdate":"201909082300","enddate":"20190909","url":"/th?id=OHR.AsburyParkNJ_EN-GB9284980454_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AsburyParkNJ_EN-GB9284980454","copyright":"Asbury Park in New Jersey, USA (© Patrick Morisson/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=asbury+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190908_2300%22","title":"Greetings from Asbury Park","caption":"Greetings from Asbury Park","copyrightonly":"© Patrick Morisson/Alamy","desc":"The warm waters of the Atlantic and a long stretch of sand bring thousands of visitors, but Asbury Park, located on the US east coast, also draws waves of art, culture and music that shine brightly in the summer months.
