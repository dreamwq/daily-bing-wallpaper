{"title":"Jupiter and the Galilean Moons","caption":"Jupiter and the Galilean Moons","desc":"On 7 January 1610, Galileo was the first person to train a telescope on Jupiter - and what he saw surprised him. Strung in a line beside the planet were three tiny stars, one to the left of the planet and two to the right. But when he observed the formation the next night, he saw that all three were on the same side. Over the following week he watched as the tiny stars (now joined by a fourth) changed their position, while remaining beside Jupiter. By 15 January he had worked it out: he was observing four moons orbiting the planet.","copyright":"Moons of Jupiter - Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (© Branko Šimunek/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=moons+of+jupiter&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200107_0000%22","date":"20200107","image":{"name":"OHR.GalileoMoons_EN-GB5907523789.jpg","hd":"/images/9FFF1A280B7C0448CCEE25AE149F6034C7DC247C64F981B51477A176EB13EAFE.jpg","tmb":"/images/E98D1F278F450B0B3F2818C7821AFC897BDA43A5030819AA7DC8CD0ADFCCACBB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GalileoMoons_EN-GB5907523789_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GalileoMoons_EN-GB5907523789_tmb.jpg"}}
