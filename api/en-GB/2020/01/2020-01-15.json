A Unesco World Heritage site, the stupa is on the ancient trade route from Tibet - traders have rested and offered prayers here for centuries. Like all stupas, Boudhanath is a mound-like structure containing relics. It was first built sometime after the 600s, when Buddhism was spreading through Tibet and Nepal. It's long been a major pilgrimage site for Buddhists, and is said to entomb the remains of Kassapa Buddha, one of the 29 named ancient Buddhas.","copyright":"Aerial view of Boudhanath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal (Â© Maksim Semin/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=boudhanath+stupa+nepal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200115_0000%22","date":"20200115","image":{"name":"OHR.Boudhanath_EN-GB1276919379.jpg","hd":"/images/390C2E8272F22E00A2EDD30146561072DB6F78E3D8F8A2A2845613E6F7FD5CBA.jpg","tmb":"/images/87BB3057A9CCE8FBC034FA7D17B829181014785542EB2066F48DB7CFC051553E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Boudhanath_EN-GB1276919379_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Boudhanath_EN-GB1276919379_tmb.jpg"}}
