{"title":"Wrapping up warm","caption":"The woolly-hatted statues of Miyajima","desc":"The stone figures lining the steps in today's photo are among 500 rakan statues on the small island of Miyajima in Japan. The colourful knitted caps they're wearing are offerings from people visiting the island, a tradition followed in other areas of Japan as well. Some believe this gift-giving is based on a children's folk story about an elderly hatmaker who was unable to make it to market on a snowy day, so he placed his collection of hats on rakan statues to keep their bare heads dry. Later, the statues showed their appreciation by delivering gifts to the hatmaker and his wife so they could celebrate the new year properly.","copyright":"Small rakan statues line the stone pathway to the Daisho-in Temple, Miyajima, Japan (Â© Malcolm Fairman/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=daisho-in+temple+miyajima+island+japan&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200111_0000%22","date":"20200111","image":{"name":"OHR.Rakan_EN-GB8352379234.jpg","hd":"/images/F2FB516736EE4FD41687963FBD4EDF36231BF8AEDBFF1B399555470F50111B8F.jpg","tmb":"/images/7BDEDBBD46398B95DE8E75EA652073A57D64E9D1126E7FD77C3D77BC2D6E2729.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Rakan_EN-GB8352379234_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Rakan_EN-GB8352379234_tmb.jpg"}}
