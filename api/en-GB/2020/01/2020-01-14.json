{"title":"Dressed for winter","caption":"Dressed for winter","desc":"It’s tough at the top, especially if the top in question is Scotland’s Cairngorm plateau mid-winter, one of the UK’s most inhospitable environments. Few creatures brave it out here all year round, but among those that do are mountain hares, which are also one of only a few British species to turn white in the winter. This special winter coat includes furry back paws to stop them sinking into the snow and makes it more difficult for them to be spotted by predators like the golden eagle.","copyright":"A mountain hare hunkers down in a snow storm, the Cairngorms (© Lyle McCalmont/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Mountain+hares&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200114_0000%22","date":"20200114","image":{"name":"OHR.SnowHare_EN-GB0866638876.jpg","hd":"/images/0751D1516DB6D3985B9A7B8EB783A6BD87489C899201F7D6C24B4CF561A4C8E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/596C221B1A1CA7202CF924FA92AF44715CA21A557C676A6510D6B901473D0313.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowHare_EN-GB0866638876_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowHare_EN-GB0866638876_tmb.jpg"}}
