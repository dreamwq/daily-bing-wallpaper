It's that unpronounceable volcano which disrupted flights back in 2010. That eruption and the vast ash cloud it belched over the North Atlantic was the biggest disruption to air traffic since World War Two. Eyjafjallajökull is a lightweight among the 32 active volcanic systems dotting the Land of Fire and Ice, its much larger neighbour Katla has been closely monitored since the 2010 incident.","copyright":"Sunlit ridges against volcanic scree on Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland (© Erlend Haarberg/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=eyjafjallajokull&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200124_0000%22","date":"20200124","image":{"name":"OHR.SunlitScree_EN-GB6676711050.jpg","hd":"/images/E6A3FC03DA19C05802236BB243866C241D7A1F55DA606586325A5377FE87D7B3.jpg","tmb":"/images/22FE2866712577D508175F67D3729F66B854AB22ED72BC8FE4D39A15D99EE885.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunlitScree_EN-GB6676711050_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunlitScree_EN-GB6676711050_tmb.jpg"}}
