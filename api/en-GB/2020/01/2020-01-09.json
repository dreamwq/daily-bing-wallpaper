{"title":"Guarding the pass","caption":"Guarding the pass","desc":"Welcome to Dolwyddelan Castle, set high on a rocky ridge against epic mountain scenery in the heart of Snowdonia National Park. This lonely keep, ruined tower and what remains of its thick curtain wall can be admired from afar. But for those willing to tackle the steep climb up, it offers commanding views over this dramatic landscape. Although it has undergone many changes over the centuries, the original building was started by Llywelyn the Great in the early 1200s – one of a group of fortresses built to command the mountain passes.","copyright":"Dolwyddelan Castle, Snowdonia National Park, Conwy (© Sebastian Wasek/Sime/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Dolwyddelan+castle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200109_0000%22","date":"20200109","image":{"name":"OHR.SnowdoniaDolwyddelan_EN-GB7426515843.jpg","hd":"/images/5FCC3EA8EB975332B983D2F2D235694CB1676327BC077031EF87BE767FE75602.jpg","tmb":"/images/82DBD716ADE41BA3B53BDAE6A6F67D75B5264E6D3A8C515DD32CA17D17A11F95.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowdoniaDolwyddelan_EN-GB7426515843_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowdoniaDolwyddelan_EN-GB7426515843_tmb.jpg"}}
