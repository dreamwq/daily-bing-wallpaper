Called Field of Light, it's on display at an arts venue called Sensorio in Paso Robles in the US state of California, the latest stop in a tour of sites around the world. Visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibres that change colour.","copyright":"Field of Light at Sensorio, by Bruce Munro, Paso Robles, California, USA (Â© George Rose/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Field+of+Light+by+Bruce+Munro&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200103_0000%22","date":"20200103","image":{"name":"OHR.MunroLight_EN-GB1666605021.jpg","hd":"/images/7E083CAEAA430659738AEBD6A687BBF7BC0A690632F97B26117C01CE3645DD0F.jpg","tmb":"/images/5AF69D596FFA49A8211EE73CB90F7FBCD3059505FE1FB56A4D12324F55FF726C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-GB1666605021_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-GB1666605021_tmb.jpg"}}
