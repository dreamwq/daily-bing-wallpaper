It's a rare photo opportunity as these majestic creatures spend much of their time deep down, over 1,000ft below the waves. On this day in 1841, a young Herman Melville set out from New Bedford, Massachusetts, USA, on a whaling voyage to the South Pacific which would help inspire his masterwork Moby-Dick. The day is celebrated at the New Bedford Whaling Museum with an annual marathon public reading of the novel - an event that lasts 25 hours.","copyright":"Sperm whale mother and albino baby swimming off the coast of Portugal (Â© Flip Nicklin/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=sperm+whale&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200104_0000%22","date":"20200104","image":{"name":"OHR.WhiteLeviathan_EN-GB2027705050.jpg","hd":"/images/E938ABCA8614BC7F5BE9E78E209C7E619D0593DA5AB25948A12BDBD3D107EE89.jpg","tmb":"/images/F5E117D52E67A0895252CEDFB10F306362DDECB7AE104F21BB8FF63580CBE80F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhiteLeviathan_EN-GB2027705050_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhiteLeviathan_EN-GB2027705050_tmb.jpg"}}
