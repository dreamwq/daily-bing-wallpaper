{"title":"Squirrelling nuts away","caption":"Squirrelling nuts away","desc":"Winter can be tough going for our red squirrels, who store food during the autumn to see them through the leaner months. They don’t hibernate but are less active at this time of year. There are about 285  squirrel species in the world, ranging from the tiny African pygmy squirrel to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel. Like most of them,  the red squirrel pictured here eats mainly nuts and berries.","copyright":"Eurasian red squirrel in the Cairngorms (© Images from BarbAnna/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=eurasian+red+squirrel&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200121_0000%22","date":"20200121","image":{"name":"OHR.HighlandsSquirrel_EN-GB4655754669.jpg","hd":"/images/DB232E3D81FC693020E831BB59D9C6E4031362A920B229B4D21FEAD7FCB25CA6.jpg","tmb":"/images/744E9ABD78C6C0D5285A05BB22454AF6B152B617DCB48895B5895FC74150710F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HighlandsSquirrel_EN-GB4655754669_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HighlandsSquirrel_EN-GB4655754669_tmb.jpg"}}
