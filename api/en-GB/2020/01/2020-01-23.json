{"title":"Serengeti baby boom","caption":"The circle of life begins again","desc":"From late January to early March, babies arrive on the Serengeti – baby wildebeest that is. At the height of the calving season, thousands of wildebeest are born every day. Moments after birth, these youngsters can walk, and in just a few days, they'll be able to run fast enough to keep up with the herd. That's a good thing. Calving season isn't just an attraction for tourists enjoying the start of the circle of life, it also brings predators like lions, cheetahs and hyenas on the hunt for easy prey.","copyright":"Zebras and wildebeest in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (© Raffi Maghdessian/Cavan Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Serengeti+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200123_0000%22","date":"20200123","image":{"name":"OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-GB6261582420.jpg","hd":"/images/DA0B6DFAA272DA9D050CB308D1701C00588DC420A0882FA99B62AC0A8DB262E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/A38E318DEE8587E9C1B908644903ADA62BB4CAA43610118CE8FD0D1975D77179.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-GB6261582420_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-GB6261582420_tmb.jpg"}}
