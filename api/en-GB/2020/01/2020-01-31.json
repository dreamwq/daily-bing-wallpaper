{"title":"Let's dance","caption":"Dance of the egret","desc":"This reddish egret might be dancing like nobody’s watching – but at this popular bird-watching site in Florida, USA, it’s likely to have a sizeable audience. The bird has a reputation for energetic feeding behaviour that resembles a frenetic dance. As it stalks its prey in shallow water, the reddish egret prances, staggers and leaps, while positioning its wings to block the glare of the sun as it boldly stabs at fish.","copyright":"A reddish egret hunts in Fort De Soto Park, Florida, USA (© Brian Lasenby/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Reddish+egret&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200131_0000%22","date":"20200131","image":{"name":"OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-GB8164577662.jpg","hd":"/images/145DCDAE0A2EA86F9B4242BB7654CD2514B81601D0F24C61881152603C665905.jpg","tmb":"/images/5DBB3254729FB5409DA0C5F0D2DB224E72953EFFB7D3605751C149F9FED7A520.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-GB8164577662_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-GB8164577662_tmb.jpg"}}
