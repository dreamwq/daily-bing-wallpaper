The 52m (170ft) high concrete dam brings a dramatic component to the scenic valley of the Rheidol river, as well as holding back up to 26,000 million litres of water. Covering 680 acres, Nant-y-Moch (which translates as the pig’s stream) is the larger of two reservoirs which help funnel rainwater down the mountains.","copyright":"High angle view of Nant-y-Moch dam and reservoir, near Aberystwyth (© Jake Gardener/EyeEm/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=nant+y+moch+reservoir&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200512_2300%22","date":"20200512","image":{"name":"OHR.NantyMoch_EN-GB3460762439.jpg","hd":"/images/9107DE1BDEFC90A2C8ADAB4C19A5EE3EE5F952736925F98BC2C1AACDBBE82495.jpg","tmb":"/images/9EE0A7992E2681F59D5C9823F8FA7A281A7C68409B993ED6CBFA27CAA22A3DD0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NantyMoch_EN-GB3460762439_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NantyMoch_EN-GB3460762439_tmb.jpg"}}
