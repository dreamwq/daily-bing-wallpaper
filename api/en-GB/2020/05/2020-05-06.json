{"title":"Winging it","caption":"Winging it over the Highlands","desc":"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? You’d be forgiven for briefly mistaking this magnificent beast for a small aircraft as it flies overhead. The UK’s second-largest bird of prey (after the white-tailed eagle), the golden eagle boasts a huge wingspan of over two metres (7ft) which it puts to good use, flying low over land before striking its prey with those impressive yellow talons. As it swoops over wild open moorland and mountains, its razor-sharp eyesight allows it to spot red grouse, ptarmigans, mountain hares and other prey from miles away.","copyright":"Golden eagle flying over a field, Glenfeshie (© Blickwinkel/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Golden+eagle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200506_2300%22","date":"20200506","image":{"name":"OHR.EagleSwoop_EN-GB3415023700.jpg","hd":"/images/0FD7A5CAB2275FA643C8CA3BFE899FBE606DA6CD783A7CB32BC4B81B2EB592B5.jpg","tmb":"/images/CD2DB1F58DD8309783B0ED7B67C9107F8B920E0741CD565800C25CA0ACB47C2F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EagleSwoop_EN-GB3415023700_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EagleSwoop_EN-GB3415023700_tmb.jpg"}}
