Today, 12 May 2020 is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, known as the Lady with the Lamp, who is credited with transforming and modernising nursing. Born into a wealthy English family living in Italy, she spurned the traditional Victorian role of housewife to embark on a career in nursing and social reform. After training in Germany and working as a nurse in London, War Secretary Sidney Herbert sent Nightingale and 38 women she had trained as nurses to help care for the wounded of the Crimean War.","copyright":"Painted and leaded glass window panel at the Florence Nightingale Museum, London (© David Gee/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=international+nurses+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200511_2300%22","date":"20200511","image":{"name":"OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-GB3125456390.jpg","hd":"/images/8EC4903F41A8393715C6287FFB1E84B8203B4DADFB772455B7430A01A6100158.jpg","tmb":"/images/893107F701D13A96FDC57861AEFF189DAA59D9DCEE6D62E9DD4DDB9909B76C37.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-GB3125456390_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-GB3125456390_tmb.jpg"}}
