{"title":"Happy World Turtle Day!","caption":"At full stretch on World Turtle Day","desc":"For the last 20 years on 23 May, turtle lovers everywhere emerge to honour these shelled reptiles, which have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years. There are more than 350 known species alive today and turtles are found on every continent, except Antarctica. But despite their wide distribution, most are endangered due to loss of habitat, illegal wildlife trade, hunting and fishing. World Turtle Day aims to change that by raising awareness about their plight and encouraging conservation efforts. So today, we invite you to stick your neck out for turtles.","copyright":"A male yellow-bellied slider (Â© Marko Markovic Photography/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=turtles&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200522_2300%22","date":"20200522","image":{"name":"OHR.SunSalutation_EN-GB9348249744.jpg","hd":"/images/9C8E555075184269656F7F7EB41F62C7978808109BCD97EE9544BC28C8B0F7F3.jpg","tmb":"/images/A78DEE1D7CC4D875E4A12155CC5E94706EE64AB25DF8CE1E3C57C78CFE4ADA9C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunSalutation_EN-GB9348249744_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunSalutation_EN-GB9348249744_tmb.jpg"}}
