{"title":"My my, it's Syttende Mai","caption":"My my, it's Syttende Mai","desc":"Home to only about 500 people, the remote Norwegian village of Henningsvær is known for its historic charm and for being part of the Lofoten archipelago's important cod fishery. And thanks to the recent boom in drone photography, the Arctic hamlet with the unlikely soccer field has come to be regarded as among the most scenic on Earth. The Henningsvær Idrettslag Stadion (in our photo's lower right) lies at Henningsvær's southern tip, on flat ground chiselled out of the rocks. Look closely at the hills around the stadium and you'll see wooden racks for drying cod, a reminder of the importance of the fishing industry here.","copyright":"Fishing village of Henningsvær with Henningsvær Idrettslag Stadion, Nordland, Norway (© Viktor Posnov/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=henningsvaer&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200516_2300%22","date":"20200516","image":{"name":"OHR.LofotenIslands_EN-GB5060716878.jpg","hd":"/images/5296EC3FFBF73259379BB47E3EE39DF418909D63CF00CE5CFD174C0312B97F02.jpg","tmb":"/images/C7165498FF83C8DE782B8B624C677FFA02DB6AE88B8710B9D38E0046F942C919.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenIslands_EN-GB5060716878_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenIslands_EN-GB5060716878_tmb.jpg"}}
