{"title":"It's World Bee Day","caption":"It's World Bee Day","desc":"We’ve got the bees to thank for this scenic view in France’s beautiful Provence region. These famously hard-working insects pollinate flowers, like the nectar-rich lavender seen growing here. Beekeepers use colonies to pollinate crops as well as collecting honey, beeswax and other products created by the hive. Inside the boxes by this field, frames hold the honeycombs that bees produce to store honey, pollen and their young.","copyright":"Fields of lavender and sunflowers with beehives in Provence, France (© leoks/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Beekeeping&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200519_2300%22","date":"20200519","image":{"name":"OHR.LavenderBee_EN-GB2556981398.jpg","hd":"/images/11FF0C091B624350A11DB6DE51995F2D4E9D9C704D1A4F4FC2742B668E772CDD.jpg","tmb":"/images/597A7B7354B16860F6698F0AD880C8236E736CF7765212D503F0045A721ED76A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-GB2556981398_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-GB2556981398_tmb.jpg"}}
