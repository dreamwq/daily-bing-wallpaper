{"title":"It's Star Wars Day","caption":"It's Star Wars Day","desc":"Does this area look familiar? If you're a Star Wars fan, you might recognise it as the planet of Crait, featured in The Last Jedi. In real life, it's Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, in Bolivia. This otherworldly landscape is high up in the Andes, nearly 12,000ft above sea level. Prehistoric lakes dried up in this area, leaving behind a salt crust several feet deep. In the rare event of rainfall here, a thin layer of perfectly still water transforms the salt flat into a giant mirror which is 80 miles across.","copyright":"Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia (Â© Ignacio Palacios/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=star+wars+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200503_2300%22","date":"20200503","image":{"name":"OHR.LastJedi_EN-GB1633848105.jpg","hd":"/images/CDA437C9B8DDDDFEED97F7235A8A8D4D22CA5D5147BCF3EBBCE626367B88654E.jpg","tmb":"/images/603D79D473851E8D77048CC7E465B7D8F14D3493BA6662CD25001A74655926CF.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-GB1633848105_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-GB1633848105_tmb.jpg"}}
