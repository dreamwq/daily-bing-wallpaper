Or maybe she knows it's World Laughter Day, which has been celebrated on the first Sunday in May since 1998. Started in India by Dr Madan Kataria, founder of the worldwide laughter yoga movement, World Laughter Day aims to raise awareness of the healing benefits of laughter. It's not about watching or reading something funny, although there's nothing wrong with that. It's about improving your mood and well-being by laughing spontaneously – for example by trying a bit of laughter yoga. However you do it, take inspiration from our owl and make some time for a laugh today.","copyright":"Snowy owl at Long Island, New York, USA (© Vicki Jauron/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=snowy+owl+bird&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200502_2300%22","date":"20200502","image":{"name":"OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-GB1221718268.jpg","hd":"/images/98A1CC5742F41C53415473467B6661D358852E35FA67E3DF64E9284D39F98C10.jpg","tmb":"/images/575583D3FF2EF4EC2F708FC60E4A61115C411F5EC8E5A2E6ADC8A253C437BF5A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-GB1221718268_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-GB1221718268_tmb.jpg"}}
