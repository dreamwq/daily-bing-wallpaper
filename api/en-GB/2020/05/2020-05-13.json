{"title":"Green fields of grain","caption":"Green fields of grain","desc":"We're looking down on the terraced hills of the Sidemen Valley, sitting in the shadow of Bali's tallest mountain, Mount Agung. In May, this Indonesian province marks the end of the harvest season for rice - a staple food here. Towns and villages are decorated with colourful flags, and farmers put up shrines to Dewi Sri, the rice goddess. Small, handmade straw dolls depicting the goddess are left here and there in further tribute.","copyright":"Rice fields in the Sidemen Valley and Mount Agung, Bali, Indonesia (Â© Jon Arnold/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mount+agung&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200513_2300%22","date":"20200513","image":{"name":"OHR.BaliRiceHarvest_EN-GB3925636571.jpg","hd":"/images/2C8E10FF5327FE96DACC9A7F7DB6FA6C0AEADBED7B06488C18C3095667A15AFD.jpg","tmb":"/images/F9F7CF0B63F9CCFE663FEC67964156392ADCF3F4B93747CA0439BE81927D1429.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BaliRiceHarvest_EN-GB3925636571_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BaliRiceHarvest_EN-GB3925636571_tmb.jpg"}}
