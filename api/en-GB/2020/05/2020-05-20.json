{"title":"A visionary artist","caption":"A visionary artist with a vibrant outlook","desc":"These colourful flowers were painted by an artist who has been visually impaired since he was a boy, after a brain tumour damaged his optic nerve. Today, Jeff Hanson is a successful artist who only vaguely sees shapes and colours. Although legally blind, he's developed a unique process that helps him feel his compositions by first plastering the canvas with a thick plastic substance. Once that hardens, he uses the ridges to navigate a piece, before adding his signature vibrant colour. He sells his art to fans like Warren Buffett, Elton John and other collectors.","copyright":"Strolling the Biltmore, a painting by Jeff Hanson (Â© Jeff Hanson Art)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=global+accessibility+awareness+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200520_2300%22","date":"20200520","image":{"name":"OHR.JeffHanson_EN-GB9142333406.jpg","hd":"/images/E11C148A07B57972CDE019C74D22C8B3550DEB5666ABCCF8FB8525700312F3A9.jpg","tmb":"/images/5F951BC3FFDF7FF56BB3724EC9317D02AC258EB73FD1CF05C66FC4D5F6E6550A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffHanson_EN-GB9142333406_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffHanson_EN-GB9142333406_tmb.jpg"}}
