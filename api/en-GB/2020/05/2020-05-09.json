{"title":"On the rocks","caption":"The metamorphic rock of Maine","desc":"Welcome to the coastal rocks of Pemaquid Point, in the US’s easternmost state, Maine. With roughly 5,000 miles of jagged, rocky coastline, Maine boasts dozens of charming lighthouses but the light at Pemaquid Point is one of the most celebrated. US President John Quincy Adams commissioned the lighthouse in 1827 but it needed to be rebuilt in 1835 after the original began falling apart. (Lesson: Don't use saltwater when mixing your mortar.) At the top of its 38ft tower is the beacon's original Fresnel lens, which is still in use. Below, the ancient metamorphic coastal rock has stripes of lighter igneous rock, creating banded ledges and lots of scenic drama.","copyright":"Pemaquid Point Light in Maine's Damariscotta region, USA (© Tom Whitney/Adobe Stock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=pemaquid+point+lighthouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200509_2300%22","date":"20200509","image":{"name":"OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-GB5582282998.jpg","hd":"/images/88DFC86BF8641B3AA35CD1D6B7001B5EC1190424A2C525BEF0E0ACFF3DC2B5EA.jpg","tmb":"/images/BB09EDD8D179FF1A85268C7942D4FF0C6BD1DE8101FCB8DA67C30AE7394AD07E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-GB5582282998_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-GB5582282998_tmb.jpg"}}
