{"title":"Clouds over the Grand Canyon","caption":"Clouds over the Grand Canyon","desc":"We'd say don't look down, but that'd be missing the point here at Toroweap Overlook, in the US state of Arizona. Situated on the Grand Canyon's North Rim, it offers an unmatched view down a sheer 3,000ft drop to the Colorado riverbed. It's one of the rewards for those who take the road less travelled to the remote North Rim, which, given that it is about 1,000ft higher on average than the more touristy South Rim, has a chillier climate and harsher weather.","copyright":"Grand Canyon and Colorado River from Toroweap Overlook, Arizona, USA  (Â© Matteo Colombo Travel Photo/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=grand+canyon+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200514_2300%22","date":"20200514","image":{"name":"OHR.NorthRimOpens_EN-GB4225783610.jpg","hd":"/images/172095569D643EF6C6B3C885F718F53ACF9C65A1B6AAC4C7CE584A41EBB55B1A.jpg","tmb":"/images/563D3BBE53F643B518986C41F76AC10E8ECCF1A67F4E39A91416B9F9A860FA41.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthRimOpens_EN-GB4225783610_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthRimOpens_EN-GB4225783610_tmb.jpg"}}
