{"title":"The Maine attraction","caption":"The sun rises over Acadia","desc":"You can enjoy a fabulous sunrise here in Acadia National Park, which has the highest rocky headlands on the USA’s Atlantic coastline. Covering much of Mount Desert island, off the coast of Maine, Acadia was designated as a national park under another name, Lafayette National Park, 101 years ago today - only to be renamed 10 years later.  Acadia packs a lot of variety into its relatively small size. You'll find miles of craggy coastline like the shore in our homepage image, woodlands, wetlands and mountains. And, at 1,530ft, the park's Cadillac Mountain is the highest point along the North Atlantic coast and the perfect place to take in the sunrise.","copyright":"Acadia National Park in Maine, USA (© emptyclouds/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Acadia+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200226_0000%22","date":"20200226","image":{"name":"OHR.AcadiaSunrise_EN-GB6985450627.jpg","hd":"/images/50A7BECB8772581204071E0B0073EB1021E79407C2B3F927060F6AD7AC1462FD.jpg","tmb":"/images/AE85AD10440D2D577AFAE74FF7A0EA460AF693B0D27ECA08A62FD12DE2C12F35.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AcadiaSunrise_EN-GB6985450627_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AcadiaSunrise_EN-GB6985450627_tmb.jpg"}}
