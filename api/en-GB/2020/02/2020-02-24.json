{"title":"Celebrating Losar","caption":"Wind horses carry wishes for a new year","desc":"For the first day of Losar, or the Tibetan New Year, we're paying a visit to these Buddhist pilgrims at the Ganden Monastery in Lhasa, Tibet. Losar is celebrated for 15 days, but most events take place in the first three days. They include wishing family members a prosperous year, praying at monasteries or temples, exchanging gifts, burning incense, chanting, wrestling and horse racing. Celebrations for the new year end with Chotrul Duchen, also known as the Butter Lamp Festival.","copyright":"Pilgrims throwing wind horses into the air above Ganden Monastery for the New Year in Tibet, China (Â© Ian Cumming/plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Losar&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200224_0000%22","date":"20200224","image":{"name":"OHR.Windhorses_EN-GB5806590081.jpg","hd":"/images/968B4AA657F2120B562102C76F3424AF16B0FF21199A882F7C6DB26CD2358CDD.jpg","tmb":"/images/ECCED3103D76F4F64781B6AF19657EF9C38C5E6868CBEDC8D0CCEDC7D1771741.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Windhorses_EN-GB5806590081_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Windhorses_EN-GB5806590081_tmb.jpg"}}
