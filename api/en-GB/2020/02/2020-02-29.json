{"title":"It's leap day!","caption":"It's leap day!","desc":"For leap day (the extra day added to February every four years), we're looking at a Wallace's flying frog. Also known as parachute frogs, these creatures live in the tropical jungles of Malaysia and Borneo. They spend most of their time in trees, gliding down to the ground to mate and lay eggs. They 'fly' by leaping and using their webbed fingers and toes to glide as far as 50 feet.","copyright":"A Wallace's flying frog glides to the forest floor (Â© Stephen Dalton/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=wallace%27s+flying+frog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200229_0000%22","date":"20200229","image":{"name":"OHR.WallaceFF_EN-GB7690348963.jpg","hd":"/images/82AC7D8C1EB508BFABDC135261DBC3BDC055FC9C94E8BCA940F20E8437441FF2.jpg","tmb":"/images/D6BBA68CC2682CCDFB4ABF8210DB698DA8B01D3C70AB659EB274A969E1D41B80.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WallaceFF_EN-GB7690348963_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WallaceFF_EN-GB7690348963_tmb.jpg"}}
