{"title":"Catwalk ready","caption":"In fine feather for London Fashion Week","desc":"This male ruff is catwalk-ready in his lavish plumage, designed to catch the eye of admiring females (who are much more modestly dressed). The males' flamboyant collars come in black, white, ginger, stripy and plain varieties which, along with their head tufts, help them compete for attention as they strut their stuff during breeding season. These wading birds breed in river meadows and coastal marshes from northern Europe to Siberia and can be spotted on the east and south coasts of the UK. They are usually passing through en route to African wetlands although some will over-winter here.","copyright":"Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) male for London Fashion Week  (Â© Loic Poidevin/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ruff+wading+bird&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200217_0000%22","date":"20200217","image":{"name":"OHR.RuffFashion_EN-GB0320601302.jpg","hd":"/images/161B3346A685667917D93DA8554EC483DFC7E98B5D65903E274F183A05A7014C.jpg","tmb":"/images/D6A7FF541B1A186C2C836C14243EBD6CB7990BECB800F8553651B3BC447C2462.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RuffFashion_EN-GB0320601302_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RuffFashion_EN-GB0320601302_tmb.jpg"}}
