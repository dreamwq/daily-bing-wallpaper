The day of the festival is filled with food, dancing, firecrackers and children’s games while night brings a quieter, more thoughtful way to start the new year. After sunset, people gather to light and release paper lanterns into the dark sky. This multiple-exposure composite image shows the trail of 'sky lanterns' as they're ascending over Pingxi, a district in Taiwan. Many people think of the lantern as representing the ‘old you’. By letting it go, you release the past and can start the new year afresh.","copyright":"Lantern Festival in Pingxi, Taiwan (© Jung-Pang Wu/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=lantern+festival&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200208_0000%22","date":"20200208","image":{"name":"OHR.PingxiLantern_EN-GB1694222971.jpg","hd":"/images/31071F3CA5A0CA9159EE9670E040F06BFC43316DC437BFE238E45B3FE8F508F4.jpg","tmb":"/images/BF951E229DE9D94C0D0EBD4D551CF8F12F3BA6F7AF07B11FA33D7CA183354A2A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PingxiLantern_EN-GB1694222971_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PingxiLantern_EN-GB1694222971_tmb.jpg"}}
