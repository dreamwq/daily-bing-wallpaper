{"title":"Signs of spring?","caption":"A hint of spring","desc":"Snowdrops are a welcome sight during the first few months of the year here in the UK. Taken as a sign that the long winter is finally on its way out, they can actually bloom as early as January, when there’s still snow underfoot and quite a bit of winter left to go. Their leaves have specially hardened tips, to help them push through frosty ground.  Plant enough bulbs, or come across a naturally occurring patch, and it can look like a light dusting of winter snow has coated the ground. Need a little hope to get you through this last stretch of winter? Look no further than the lovely snowdrop.","copyright":"A snowdrop in bloom (© Péter Hegedűs/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=galanthus+nivalis&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200206_0000%22","date":"20200206","image":{"name":"OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-GB0217805831.jpg","hd":"/images/8653CC600921D7B2B0184E94F3D8E0E90E96F7EF7A7352F087090FFFFC0BF034.jpg","tmb":"/images/CD9A00500F544A9AD2141E2D5AF78A23C8401473CFCE8EFED36EA942655DFB62.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-GB0217805831_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-GB0217805831_tmb.jpg"}}
