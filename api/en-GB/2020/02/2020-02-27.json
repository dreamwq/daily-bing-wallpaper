Although polar bears aren’t endangered, their conservation status is considered ‘vulnerable’ and these magnificent beasts have become a sort of mascot for the race to stop the melting of Arctic sea ice. Arctic ice is crucial to the bears' survival, as they hunt the ringed seals that bob up through its holes. As the ice decreases, so does the hunting ground – which is bad news for our bears.","copyright":"A polar bear and her cubs in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, USA (© Steven Kazlowski/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=polar+bear&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200227_0000%22","date":"20200227","image":{"name":"OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-GB7454806618.jpg","hd":"/images/9091EB7FC79E8AF667C18284F986F93A4A7D48001BAADE6C474D012116E29E43.jpg","tmb":"/images/C1BAF195B5C798146D39EEBBB6F81AC85654574FCFD69ABD08A2F2E183B2FDF9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-GB7454806618_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-GB7454806618_tmb.jpg"}}
