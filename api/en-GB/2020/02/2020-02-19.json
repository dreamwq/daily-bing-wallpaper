{"title":"Flocking together","caption":"Flocking together in the Antarctic","desc":"They might be a few days late for Valentine's Day, but these birds look like they're in the mood for love. Wandering albatrosses (also known as snowy albatrosses, white-winged albatrosses, or goonies) mostly live on the open ocean but arrive on land for mating season. A gland on the top of their nasal passages allows them to survive drinking saltwater as they feed on small marine animals. They can float on the sea surface and glide for hours.","copyright":"Wandering albatross pair, South Georgia island (Â© David Tipling Photo Library/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=wandering+albatross&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200219_0000%22","date":"20200219","image":{"name":"OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-GB3436486989.jpg","hd":"/images/CA6345841F40F75E33D196451E00376A9C4D2093970622A64F781D70F934E555.jpg","tmb":"/images/3727CAF29B0601FAD2E3FB297AE0D2A5F50B6DE3D23D79CC22CE0012E26A5D32.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-GB3436486989_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-GB3436486989_tmb.jpg"}}
