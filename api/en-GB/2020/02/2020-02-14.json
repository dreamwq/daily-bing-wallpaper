{"title":"Happy Valentine's Day","caption":"Corsica's heart of stone","desc":"If you really want to earn someone's affections, fly them to Corsica, rent a car and take a drive on the only road that cuts through the red volcanic rocks of Calanques de Piana. Some call the rock formation in today’s Valentine's Day photo the Two Lovers - others call it the Heart of Corsica. Erosion over the years has transformed the red porphyry rock here into the geological sculptures, craggy cliffs and heart-shaped hole we see today. And like many affairs of the heart, the path to this geological Valentine is full of twists and turns. It's a winding road, sometimes too narrow to share with traffic coming the opposite way. Our vantage point may be a good spot for you to pull over, especially if it’s sunset, to see the rocks aglow as the sun creeps west towards the horizon.","copyright":"A heart-shaped hole in the rocks of Calanques de Piana in Corsica, France (© joningall/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=calanques+de+piana+corsica&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200214_0000%22","date":"20200214","image":{"name":"OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-GB8995804668.jpg","hd":"/images/5E144AE43ED3A9646BA69E08C6EDC6EF702A79CA3C35034A4E3990B1F03809F4.jpg","tmb":"/images/91C5B1FD02C4A68BB1BD5E282A223ABA54EEBF0AAE9B0A6A8E9D11CEE3CDB9D4.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-GB8995804668_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-GB8995804668_tmb.jpg"}}
