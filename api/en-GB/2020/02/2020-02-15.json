{"title":"Whales in winter","caption":"Whales in winter","desc":"Winter brings large numbers of humpback whales to the icy waters off the Norwegian coast, where they feed on herring and krill and delight whale watchers with powerful leaps and tail-slaps. Male humpbacks are famous for their haunting songs, which can last up to 20 minutes and are heard over great distances underwater. Scientists aren’t sure exactly why the males sing these ballads, but some think it’s related to courtship.","copyright":"Humpback whale feeding on herring off the coast of Kvaløya, Troms, Northern Norway (© Espen Bergersen/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=humpback+whale&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200215_0000%22","date":"20200215","image":{"name":"OHR.HumpbackHerring_EN-GB9370908186.jpg","hd":"/images/C2A4C395D6C888EC88D6420A4D01CF877616C441161456D4B17B82010053A695.jpg","tmb":"/images/2C2E2037954D5F38148CE49D6123A7A216D741F986DD17F9C50A11F3C7ACEBFA.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumpbackHerring_EN-GB9370908186_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumpbackHerring_EN-GB9370908186_tmb.jpg"}}
