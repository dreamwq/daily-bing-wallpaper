{"title":"Carnival comes to Olinda","caption":"Carnival comes to Olinda","desc":"It's the first official day of Carnival in Olinda and the streets in the historic part of town will fill with people who come out to see dozens of giant puppets parade through. The larger-than-life 'bonecos de Olinda' kick off the festivities each year and have been part of the celebrations here for more than a century. But Carnival in Olinda is not only about these incredible puppets, which can be up to 20ft tall. Like other Brazilian celebrations, expect music, dancing, costumes and lots of fun.","copyright":"Giant puppets for Carnival in Olinda, Brazil (Â© Pulsar Imagens/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=olinda+brazil&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200221_0000%22","date":"20200221","image":{"name":"OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-GB4451522356.jpg","hd":"/images/01395E39EE73B039EDA68CDA0848D1411B42E404D84401141AA44A10A7D5CDFB.jpg","tmb":"/images/6EE41C74040C8EA939DE65FDC5BAFAC937C9FFBA5579C98394E62D9BD2BC0C8D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-GB4451522356_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-GB4451522356_tmb.jpg"}}
