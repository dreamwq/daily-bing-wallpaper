{"title":"Jerte Valley in bloom","caption":"Jerte Valley in bloom","desc":"As winter turns to spring in the Jerte Valley, all eyes are on the cherry blossoms. This tiny region in the province of Cáceres, Spain, has the perfect microclimate for cherry trees, and there are more than 1.5 million of them here in just 23 square miles. Sadly, it’s an all-too-brief phenomenon. Cherry blossoms last barely two weeks before fluttering to the ground, spreading a blanket of petals over the entire valley. About 40 days later, the first cherries are ready to be picked. Locals use them to make wine, beer and various dishes, as well as in spa and beauty treatments.","copyright":"Blooming cherry trees in Jerte Valley, Province of Cáceres, Spain (© Westend61/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jerte+Spain&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200315_0000%22","date":"20200315","image":{"name":"OHR.JerteCherries_EN-GB9317904891.jpg","hd":"/images/C632483989DEEB2325EC235EE6DAEB7AAFDEBAB8862C496EFF779EB358EA5A75.jpg","tmb":"/images/6C7ACAA702CA5F6CC811DA5090A1F56BFA912B82AF1DF89BA5B140BEC82B9EEC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JerteCherries_EN-GB9317904891_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JerteCherries_EN-GB9317904891_tmb.jpg"}}
