A cenote is a sinkhole which is created when the limestone bedrock collapses and exposes groundwater underneath, creating pools of fresh water that delight swimmers and cave divers. They’re diving in ‘El Pit’ Cenote, part of a flooded cave system near Tulum. It’s one of thousands of cenotes documented on the Yucatán, and a popular spot for divers who come to swim through the brilliant sunbeams.","copyright":"Divers at El Pit Cenote, located in Dos Ojos Natural Park, Quintana Roo, Mexico (© Christia Vizl/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=cenote&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200304_0000%22","date":"20200304","image":{"name":"OHR.ElPit_EN-GB9826785554.jpg","hd":"/images/7DD806089C88798BB122BF282F60DEA1E56D9A83F083BAE33D24529D3E1C7BD3.jpg","tmb":"/images/E2292CA059ABE0C5D6D241162EEE4DA0A3A6B2B4B79AF551DD30B0DFAACA1C61.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElPit_EN-GB9826785554_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElPit_EN-GB9826785554_tmb.jpg"}}
