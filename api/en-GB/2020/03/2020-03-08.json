{"title":"International Women’s Day","caption":"The struggle for women’s suffrage","desc":"On International Women’s Day we’re looking back to Knightsbridge, London in May 1909 - a time when women didn’t have the vote here in the UK. The Women’s Exhibition included political stands like this one selling the suffragettes’ newspaper alongside stalls selling hats, books and sweets. All were decked out in purple, green and white – the colours of the Women’s Social and Political Union, the suffragette organisation founded by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, for which the exhibition raised funds and publicity. The exhibition was captured on camera by Christina Broom, considered the UK’s first female press photographer.","copyright":"The catalogue and enquiries stall at the Women's Exhibition, London, May 1909.
