{"title":"Mirror on the fells","caption":"Reflecting the beauty of the fells","desc":"As the sun rises on Loughrigg Tarn, in the heart of the Lake District, you can see why the poet William Wordsworth likened it to Italy’s Lake Nemi, describing it as “Diana’s looking glass … round, clear and bright as Heaven”. This small, nearly circular tarn just north of Windermere reflects surrounding fells in its clear waters which, in the summer, are decorated with water lillies. Of the 16 lakes in the Lake District, only one is actually called a lake – that’s Bassenthwaite Lake. All the others are “meres” or “waters”. And then there are numerous smaller tarns like this one - \"tarn\" is derived from the Old Norse word for pool.","copyright":"Loughrigg Tarn sunrise, Ambleside, Lake District (© John Finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Loughrigg+Tarn&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200313_0000%22","date":"20200313","image":{"name":"OHR.LoughriggTarn_EN-GB5418287139.jpg","hd":"/images/1125C2547939E4D65DAA085C12E390127EFAB537709D4CC4006C93D1D264D52F.jpg","tmb":"/images/7D4899E2D1AFCE9F0DFC3BD40F220D9A44BC7BA32A78B88A040FEDA706492726.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LoughriggTarn_EN-GB5418287139_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LoughriggTarn_EN-GB5418287139_tmb.jpg"}}
