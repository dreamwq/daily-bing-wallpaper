{"title":"Happy St David's Day!","caption":"The colossal splendour of Conwy Castle","desc":"We’re celebrating St David’s Day here on the north coast of Wales in the spectacular walled town of Conwy. For more than seven centuries, Conwy Castle has towered over its narrow streets, against the mountainous skyline of Snowdonia. In its heyday it would have been white – lime render can still be seen on the walls – but even in its darker state it makes quite the impression, soaring out of a natural rock formation at the mouth of the River Conwy. Climb its battlements and you will be treated to sweeping views of the mountains, the sea, Conwy itself and the castle’s roofless Great Hall.","copyright":"Conwy Castle illuminated at night, Conwy (© Jon Arnold/DanitaDelimont.com)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Conwy+Castle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200301_0000%22","date":"20200301","image":{"name":"OHR.ConwyCastle_EN-GB7873392974.jpg","hd":"/images/B22580F4F915AC7F7FAEC42473F4035260DBBA1D0EEF2A30A1FE2778EFB37639.jpg","tmb":"/images/08F8276111A459B7DAC255397E02721D2BC4DA5905F16DD85B9CD22A9CB13B34.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ConwyCastle_EN-GB7873392974_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ConwyCastle_EN-GB7873392974_tmb.jpg"}}
