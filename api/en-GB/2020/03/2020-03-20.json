At sunrise on the spring equinox, the sun aligns with the top of the main tower at Angkor Wat before climbing further into the sky to usher in longer days and shorter nights. Of course, if this photo is any indication, every sunrise at Angkor Wat is spectacular.","copyright":"Sunrise at Angkor Wat in Cambodia (Â© Sergio Diaz/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Angkor+Wat&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200320_0000%22","date":"20200320","image":{"name":"OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-GB1042086388.jpg","hd":"/images/8FB6528FE8FC8169BC70351765D2D885D500DDE07CFE2C4ED0C7F3FBFA63F43E.jpg","tmb":"/images/75CC2D40765BAFD5F9F6B869BC0182021CA698FC29E6A2E89ADC612C517211E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-GB1042086388_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-GB1042086388_tmb.jpg"}}
