{"title":"Going on a bee hunt","caption":"Going on a bee hunt","desc":"As the name suggests, European bee-eaters eat bees - as well as other insects. They catch them in midair, carry them to a perch and pound them to rub out the venom, making them safe to eat. One of Europe’s most colourful birds, they are still an unusual sight in the UK although sightings have increased in recent springs – something thought to have been influenced by climate change. You can find them throughout southern Europe, especially in nature reserves and parks. These two are enjoying the abundant sunshine in the Extremadura region of Spain, known as a great area for birdwatching.","copyright":"European bee-eaters in the Extremadura region of Spain (© Martin Demmel/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=european+bee+eaters&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200324_0000%22","date":"20200324","image":{"name":"OHR.SpainBeeEaters_EN-GB7730770385.jpg","hd":"/images/1AF56CBA48195EABC6F7AD5C9203F13CADFCB7A045C7B7AE98948724F4921641.jpg","tmb":"/images/DA882D2B250710AD0D61A6C0F68F0A341BFC717BAB40A7782AE8445EE5922DF9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpainBeeEaters_EN-GB7730770385_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpainBeeEaters_EN-GB7730770385_tmb.jpg"}}
