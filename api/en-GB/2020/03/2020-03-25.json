While Tolkien never worked in the Radcliffe Camera (Latin for 'room'), he studied at Oxford (graduating in 1915 with a first-class honours in English language) and taught here as a professor. During his years at Oxford, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, along with other books and research.","copyright":"The Radcliffe Camera, Oxford for Tolkien Reading Day (Â© Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=JRR+Tolkien&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200325_0000%22","date":"20200325","image":{"name":"OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-GB8604998548.jpg","hd":"/images/70DDDBEC883677150C9D0C5AC368BDD1F9C4BCFA7092F0073FBE2E7A6B0F1774.jpg","tmb":"/images/8D5BE073F9284EA7F3AEF47EE7D41DB752B9971341BF0D7DC0835558787E04EE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-GB8604998548_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-GB8604998548_tmb.jpg"}}
