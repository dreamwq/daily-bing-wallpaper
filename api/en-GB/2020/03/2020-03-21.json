{"title":"Stepping down","caption":"The ancient stepwells of Jaipur","desc":"Stepwells originated in western India over 1,000 years ago as way for people living in that arid climate to get easy and reliable access to fresh water, even during the driest months. The Panna Meena Ka Kund stepwell in Jaipur is a classic example of the beautiful geometric architecture used to produce them. Most stepwells also feature shaded side chambers where locals (primarily women) can gather to escape the heat of the day. In this image, one can see obvious signs of previous high-water marks on the well’s walls as seasonal fluctuations and the changing climate affect water levels throughout the region.","copyright":"Women climbing a stepwell near Amber Fort in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India (© Shanna Baker/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Stepwells+&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200321_0000%22","date":"20200321","image":{"name":"OHR.StepWell_EN-GB4302170044.jpg","hd":"/images/FF4908213654F119E443CAC579C222D0F701544342DE9259E16199965187F0A2.jpg","tmb":"/images/23C0D62687A18C00AD63CBE44D66DF43A0F3CCE67B63D638F9B4F6C9BD125213.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-GB4302170044_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-GB4302170044_tmb.jpg"}}
