The Twist looks like a futuristic intrusion in the dense woods and preserved historic buildings of Jevnaker, Norway, home to the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park. The Twist is a bridge, but it’s also an art gallery. Its unique construction features straight panels set at increasing angles as one moves toward the centre, to create a 90-degree turn where a wall becomes the ceiling and vice versa.","copyright":"The Twist bridges the Randselva River, at the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park in Norway (© Laurian Ghinitoiu)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=kistefos+museum+sculpture+park+norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200330_2300%22","date":"20200330","image":{"name":"OHR.TheTwist_EN-GB2035350773.jpg","hd":"/images/593F5DE87F89D54759557C8C54F404937E8F9998513B3A8B438F8BD9222CEBEE.jpg","tmb":"/images/23640C6387184105931B0FEE1EC463B2B634D78411E11CC18610750156D2AB43.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheTwist_EN-GB2035350773_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheTwist_EN-GB2035350773_tmb.jpg"}}
