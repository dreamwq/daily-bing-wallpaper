{"title":"The borrowed days are here","caption":"The borrowed days are here","desc":"This photo of a European crested tit weathering a late-winter storm in Scotland just about sums up the month of March for those of us in the northern hemisphere. While the calendar tells us spring has arrived, the weather often seems to disagree. It’s the blustery, unpredictable elements of this time of year that inspired an old folktale that the month of March ‘borrowed’ three days from April so that it could indulge in a few final winter-like days. These ‘borrowed days’ are the last three days of the month. Perhaps take comfort that it’s only three days. In some parts of Ireland, March was said to have borrowed nine days. That’s too many days.","copyright":"A European crested tit weathers a storm in Scotland (© Ben Hall/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Crested+tit+Parus+cristatus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200329_2300%22","date":"20200329","image":{"name":"OHR.BorrowingDays_EN-GB3502278588.jpg","hd":"/images/654D76F1E26D16D1C0D3AE4D36ED1F8FF84F346C429AD59597ACF699C36FC811.jpg","tmb":"/images/D2AF073736A7DE04A28E87B19F01F93C71012336A341096DD9906C276F13FB10.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BorrowingDays_EN-GB3502278588_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BorrowingDays_EN-GB3502278588_tmb.jpg"}}
