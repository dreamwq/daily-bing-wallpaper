{"title":"Happy Mothering Sunday","caption":"A little owl love on Mothering Sunday","desc":"This little owl is shown feeding her baby son as we celebrate Mothering Sunday here in the UK. The UK’s smallest owl, they reach full height at around 20cm – so are quickly caught up by their offspring. With striking yellow eyes and a mottled brown and cream colouring, it is not unusual to spot little owls sitting on fence posts like this one during the daytime, scouring the ground for food – from crickets and beetles to small mammals. They nest in holes – usually in trees but, thanks to their small stature, can set up homes in abandoned rabbit burrows and cavities in buildings and rocks.","copyright":"Mother owl dotes on her newborn son at their farmyard abode (© Cavan Images/Media Drum World/Laura Dyer)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Athene+noctua+owl&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200322_0000%22","date":"20200322","image":{"name":"OHR.MotherOwl_EN-GB1698955508.jpg","hd":"/images/36D68CA02B8F8BDFCF8B042B6445FCBB4947F39A39CA32C80C0C31CD3B06D87D.jpg","tmb":"/images/35CBD41FEE00D9EAFEBF007FEF1C6D1CC3F45F640B135A51D996960C84D96B64.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MotherOwl_EN-GB1698955508_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MotherOwl_EN-GB1698955508_tmb.jpg"}}
