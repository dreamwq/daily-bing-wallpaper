This Unesco World Heritage Site is also home to the Newgrange and Dowth passage graves, henges and standing stones, as well as having Europe's largest concentration of megalithic art. Knowth, the largest in the complex, is a 40ft mound, 220ft wide with two passages beneath it which lead to separate burial chambers.","copyright":"Knowth burial mound in Newgrange, Boyne Valley, Ireland for St Patrick's Day (© whatapicture/plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=st+patrick%27s+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200317_0000%22","date":"20200317","image":{"name":"OHR.Knowth_EN-GB8330594756.jpg","hd":"/images/18436F70A80F9CE558584FCC6B8583C3A1A878F2B248335C024D7C99AE813F5D.jpg","tmb":"/images/12E3E714DCA22EAFB9AF1A522347ABEF35A3BC9306624BE56AA2AD4C01260A4E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Knowth_EN-GB8330594756_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Knowth_EN-GB8330594756_tmb.jpg"}}
