{"title":"The lone tree of Llyn Padarn","caption":"The lone tree of Llyn Padarn","desc":"This serene scene on Llyn Padarn, a glacially formed lake at the foot of Snowdon, is a photographer's favourite with its solitary tree set against a dramatic landscape. Sitting on the western shore of the lake, the 'Lone Tree' is visually striking at any time – be it full of leaves and set against a sunrise in the spring, leafless and mirrored in the still waters of the lake or enveloped in mist in the autumn and winter.","copyright":"Sunrise at Llyn Padarn at Llanberis, Snowdonia National Park (© Helen Hotson/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Llyn+Padarn&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200430_2300%22","date":"20200430","image":{"name":"OHR.LoneTree_EN-GB0128181510.jpg","hd":"/images/4CA3C944D3F243C611375CA796C920AA07BFFD369C6AF39A49816FECD4652334.jpg","tmb":"/images/4C1C2E8576EA2DCA30E2F8B4351528C1E8D79B2836C19A67835E66C5254C5061.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LoneTree_EN-GB0128181510_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LoneTree_EN-GB0128181510_tmb.jpg"}}
