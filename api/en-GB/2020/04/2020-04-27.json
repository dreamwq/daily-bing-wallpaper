The massive church's first foundation stones were laid here, then called New Sarum, on 28 April, 1220. The structure itself dates back even further, the bulk of it having been moved over a mile, piece by piece, from the former Roman stronghold of Old Sarum.","copyright":"Salisbury Cathedral with grazing flock of sheep, Wiltshire (Â© Slawek Staszczuk Photo/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=salisbury+cathedral&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200427_2300%22","date":"20200427","image":{"name":"OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-GB4998816515.jpg","hd":"/images/FE3B9A08B7F9DE8BEDFE98ADDFA72D7ED1EE3836BB9D982FCBE0DBA5E076632D.jpg","tmb":"/images/F60AC7DDB90BB82FACF4CDE65AB28A7CB896F4AC2D0E700970E212EBD1F5E5ED.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-GB4998816515_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-GB4998816515_tmb.jpg"}}
