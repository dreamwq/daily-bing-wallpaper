{"title":"Santorini through the clouds","caption":"Santorini through the clouds","desc":"With its romantic sunsets, dazzling ocean views and whitewashed buildings on rocky clifftops, Santorini (aka Thera) is an island idyll in the Aegean Sea. But beneath this Greek island’s tranquility lies an explosive history, for this is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history. The Minoan eruption, about 3,600 years ago, caused the centre of the Thera volcano to collapse into the ocean, leaving Santorini a jagged, crescent-shaped moon above the sea.","copyright":"Aerial view of Santorini island, Greece (© Amazing Aerial Agency/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=santorini+greece&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200428_2300%22","date":"20200428","image":{"name":"OHR.SantoriniAerial_EN-GB8545348049.jpg","hd":"/images/B5958EFDD6CBEB1C869430AF2392A35C7BD1D7AE7E1CFDFB716878F11254D9D5.jpg","tmb":"/images/0FEE72ACE691EAF2C1D1958EB479D2A7EBEC4A647F9010F672E2308AA0297BE9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantoriniAerial_EN-GB8545348049_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantoriniAerial_EN-GB8545348049_tmb.jpg"}}
