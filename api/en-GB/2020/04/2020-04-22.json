{"title":"Happy St George's Day","caption":"George the dragon slayer","desc":"England’s patron saint is thought to have been born 2,000 miles away in Cappadocia, Turkey and is said to have died on 23 April 303 AD – executed after the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the persecution of Christians. That date has been celebrated as an important feast date in England for hundreds of years. However, if it falls too close to Easter, as it did in 2019, it is delayed until the following week under Church of England rules – so it can be, quite literally, a moveable feast.","copyright":"Monument to St George and the Dragon at sunset, Moscow, Russia (© Protasov AN/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=st+george%27s+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200422_2300%22","date":"20200422","image":{"name":"OHR.GeorgeDragon_EN-GB6870297920.jpg","hd":"/images/814549836E39E3EC00412154F35FDECE1600A8A77E790108CFF09E1CE4E5DDCF.jpg","tmb":"/images/F429C285562B5D7703D1D3DD13F826F8408CE26D60E5ABD216E3D4ABC9DF2DD1.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GeorgeDragon_EN-GB6870297920_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GeorgeDragon_EN-GB6870297920_tmb.jpg"}}
