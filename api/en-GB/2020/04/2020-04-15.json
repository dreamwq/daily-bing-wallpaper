{"title":"Bridges to the past","caption":"Bridges to the past","desc":"The story of this striking sandstone formation in the US state of Utah begins around 10 million years ago. That's when tectonic shifts began slowly lifting the 130,000 square-mile Colorado Plateau above the surrounding plains. Later streams from the Colorado River cut through the elevated land, creating deep canyons. When water broke through a canyon wall, sometimes a natural bridge like this one remained above the gap between canyons.","copyright":"Sipapu Bridge in Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah, USA (Â© Fyletto/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=natural+bridges+national+monument&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200415_2300%22","date":"20200415","image":{"name":"OHR.NBNMSipapu_EN-GB6692836563.jpg","hd":"/images/38FD8D2CE9B15381AE4CDAFF7F05888885F6CB99945BDCC0A375F1C2B4D825EF.jpg","tmb":"/images/34BD28046083618BB5A0F491129B8122044FBF203A4CE41ABDD441D57194C6FB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NBNMSipapu_EN-GB6692836563_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NBNMSipapu_EN-GB6692836563_tmb.jpg"}}
