{"title":"Dancing with daffodils","caption":"Dancing with daffodils","desc":"We’re marking the 250th anniversary of the birth of one of England’s greatest poets, William Wordsworth, with an image of Dora’s Field, Rydal in the Lake District. Dora was Wordsworth’s daughter and when she died in 1847 he and his wife Mary planted hundreds of daffodils here in her memory. Daffodils are of course synonymous with Wordsworth thanks to his most famous poem: I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud, which was written while he was living at Dove Cottage in Grasmere.","copyright":"Daffodils in Dora’s Field, Rydal, Lake District (© Simon Whaley Landscapes/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=William+Wordsworth&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200406_2300%22","date":"20200406","image":{"name":"OHR.WordsworthDaffodils_EN-GB1458624048.jpg","hd":"/images/0E52335ACBEC9A4EB54C96EF6E1AF353E37AF627EED23D788854CB451EF00C27.jpg","tmb":"/images/447886B9DC5CAF8A1C7FE3B916066CB206E4F3498BCD169EB1625EAF2CFEBB9C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WordsworthDaffodils_EN-GB1458624048_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WordsworthDaffodils_EN-GB1458624048_tmb.jpg"}}
