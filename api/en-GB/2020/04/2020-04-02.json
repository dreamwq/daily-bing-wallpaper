{"title":"Follow the rainbow","caption":"Follow the rainbow","desc":"Welcome to Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, a great place to mark Find a Rainbow Day. Scottish explorer David Livingstone named the waterfall in honour of Queen Victoria, although it's also known by its indigenous Lozi name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means 'the smoke that thunders'. According to some records, local villagers described the waterfall to Livingstone as 'Seongo' or 'Chongwe', which means 'the place of the rainbow', because rainbows appear in its spray. Under a bright moon, you might also see a 'moonbow' here.","copyright":"Rainbow at Victoria Falls in Zambia (Â© Dietmar Temps/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=victoria+falls&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200402_2300%22","date":"20200402","image":{"name":"OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-GB6944289342.jpg","hd":"/images/DA3F94204B950C6B1455635113389A760E9B4E7296B15EE80182BBDE73CE5F09.jpg","tmb":"/images/1FB970E7121314C80791CC0286115E5A8D685DBDBC26F927103E92CD415D4406.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-GB6944289342_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlaceofRainbows_EN-GB6944289342_tmb.jpg"}}
