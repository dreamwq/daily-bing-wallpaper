{"title":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","caption":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","desc":"For World Penguin Day, we're featuring a lively group of southern rockhopper penguins on a Falkland Islands beach. Most penguins slide over the ice on their bellies, but these small penguins are a bit more aerobic - they hop. Rockhoppers are among the most common penguin species but pollution, overfishing and climate change have taken a toll. Their population has declined by about 30 percent over the last 30 years. Today, there are an estimated 1.5 million breeding pairs of rockhoppers. About 1 million of those are southern rockhopper couples – the rest are made up of the northern and eastern rockhoppers.","copyright":"Southern rockhopper penguins on the Falkland Islands (© Heike Odermatt/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=rockhopper+penguin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200424_2300%22","date":"20200424","image":{"name":"OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-GB2947648355.jpg","hd":"/images/EA71B2138529542A13FD7C279B46A6E737AAE1B28156FFB5477A085B45B587D1.jpg","tmb":"/images/AECA67F49B4F0F4450428C37B4002A248C0001F46725E38CB195CDB7B3D4DEB9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-GB2947648355_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-GB2947648355_tmb.jpg"}}
