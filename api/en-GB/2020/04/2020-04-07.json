{"title":"Once in a pink moon","caption":"Once in a pink moon","desc":"We're seeing a vivid 'pink moon' rise above St Michael's Mount, the rocky island connected to Cornwall by sandy flats and a causeway that disappears beneath the water at high tide. The same order of monks which established France's Mont-Saint-Michel built a church and priory here in the 12th century. In ensuing centuries of war, the monastic outpost was fortified into the imposing castle we see today. Privately purchased in 1659, the mount opened to the public in 1954 and is still managed by members of the family that bought it over 350 years ago.","copyright":"The April full moon, or pink moon, rises over St Michael's Mount, Cornwall (Â© Simon Maycock/Alamy Live News)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=st+michael%27s+mount&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200407_2300%22","date":"20200407","image":{"name":"OHR.PinkMoon_EN-GB2107956871.jpg","hd":"/images/80E207424CE0F57C96FAF77FFC4FCDF16FE0839011C6D8DCF6762D1E2A9AA723.jpg","tmb":"/images/DF1C97465FDF1DA77FA0976F186A05D8A20DE6BDABDE47FD7A4095293487C7A6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinkMoon_EN-GB2107956871_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinkMoon_EN-GB2107956871_tmb.jpg"}}
