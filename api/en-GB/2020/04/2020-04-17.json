{"title":"In full flow","caption":"Yosemite in full flow","desc":"This spectacular scene is Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, in the US state of California. At this time of year, the waterfall flows in a torrent over the edge of this cliff, but by late summer it can be reduced to a trickle of small streams. Vernal Fall is usually at full power by May, as the spring thaw in the mountains melts the snowpack, which becomes a raging tumble of water as it makes its way to the valley floor.","copyright":"Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, California, USA (Â© elvistudio/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=yosemite+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200417_2300%22","date":"20200417","image":{"name":"OHR.VernalFalls_EN-GB3094503280.jpg","hd":"/images/40D416F56F380D61CB1D700CC4814A05F8D1B0937143376D2E9330243B3560ED.jpg","tmb":"/images/A0047673D53C8EC1CD74539B12CC5772A3F6D1DC899B31BF53028DA0ABA1F413.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VernalFalls_EN-GB3094503280_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VernalFalls_EN-GB3094503280_tmb.jpg"}}
