Like its namesake, the great astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope has transformed our understanding of the cosmos. Some of the telescope's greatest contributions include its Deep Field Images, which look back billions of lightyears, or its jaw-dropping images of objects closer to home.","copyright":"The Large Magellanic Cloud, photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope (© ESA/Hubble/NASA)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=hubble+space+telescope&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200423_2300%22","date":"20200423","image":{"name":"OHR.MegellanicCloud_EN-GB2585801293.jpg","hd":"/images/B0C67B3095EB2B30435B067A9FDDF949A7D13F1DFA85169D90AE63FFCCF29524.jpg","tmb":"/images/E030D1707D9E74364B7B7FE1CF881CF02B2D581BB236A1DE7FC413242BD2DB6B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MegellanicCloud_EN-GB2585801293_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MegellanicCloud_EN-GB2585801293_tmb.jpg"}}
