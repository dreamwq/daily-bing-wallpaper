{"title":"Bluebell haze","caption":"Forest floors spring to life","desc":"The sweet scent of wild bluebells wafts through Micheldever Wood, in Hampshire, at this time of year. This ancient wood, largely made up of beech trees, offers the perfect leafy cover for the native Hyacinthoides Non-scripta, as they thrive in the dappled shade on the forest floor. Bluebells are great for woodlands’ ecosystems, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies but they are delicate and take a while to get established – so watch where you step and don’t go picking them, native wild bluebells are protected by law.","copyright":"Bluebells in Micheldever Wood, Hampshire (© Hursley/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=bluebells&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200416_2300%22","date":"20200416","image":{"name":"OHR.BluebellWood_EN-GB7185610049.jpg","hd":"/images/91E4F06D551681C5C3D29C092913F07EE2F3D6CDC077D1428D1D0B730E12B3DE.jpg","tmb":"/images/B411FB831AAA9AA5EBCD5698AB79A432ED9D7A1E93E89E421CEAE2F4CEC3274E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BluebellWood_EN-GB7185610049_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BluebellWood_EN-GB7185610049_tmb.jpg"}}
