{"title":"Colours spring up in Yellowstone","caption":"Colours spring up in Yellowstone","desc":"Let’s take a closer look at the Grand Prismatic Spring, one of the most popular attractions in Yellowstone National Park in the western United States. Here amazing colours form due to hot water rising, cooling and falling, which creates rings of different temperatures inside the spring. The blue centre is the hottest part, where almost nothing lives. But the other rings are home to different organisms which give the water its colourful rings. Although it’s beautiful to look at, you wouldn’t want to swim in it. Firstly, because it’s illegal to do so. But also because it’s much too hot - and you may not appreciate that post-dip sulfur smell.","copyright":"The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA (© Martin Rügner/DEEPOL by plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=grand+prismatic+spring+yellowstone&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200420_2300%22","date":"20200420","image":{"name":"OHR.GPS_EN-GB1822760655.jpg","hd":"/images/EB825DA1E4D29E7877CA397EB1790FB487F358CB54D77B0B54744D65B99DD5AC.jpg","tmb":"/images/7386A87421DB0437C45B723C28E19B641753A9C0A6A704192A39064987FC7DA4.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-GB1822760655_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-GB1822760655_tmb.jpg"}}
