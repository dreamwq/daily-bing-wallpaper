{"title":"Feathering Arctic nests","caption":"Feathering nests in the Arctic Circle","desc":"These colourful little eggs are those of the hoary redpoll, also known as the Arctic redpoll because of its extreme northern habitat. This hardy finch spends much of its time, including breeding season, in the brushy tundra of the northern polar regions. Because of the extreme cold, the female will often line her nest with feathers, such as those of the white ptarmigan.","copyright":"Arctic redpoll nest in Lapland, Finland (Â© Maximilian Buzun/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=arctic+redpoll&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200429_2300%22","date":"20200429","image":{"name":"OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-GB9277556732.jpg","hd":"/images/06DB8E898EF2DD4172740E13DE535E96153ABB8A2361AE77630667EEF92B7F83.jpg","tmb":"/images/2D1EE9A5CAD5D63E24EA277E68D816AB3FBA331890A7EAC6094D9B6CF8D6ACE3.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-GB9277556732_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-GB9277556732_tmb.jpg"}}
