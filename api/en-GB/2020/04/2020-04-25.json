{"title":"Red skies at Ruby Beach","caption":"Red skies at Ruby Beach","desc":"Reddish crystals in the sand inspired the name of Ruby Beach, in Olympic National Park in the US state of Washington. A few miles from the shore is Destruction Island, where birds such as rhinoceros auklets can stop and rest after a day of snacking on krill and squid in the cold Pacific waters. While the park includes miles of colourful Pacific coastline, it's also famous for the Hoh Rainforest, notable for its towering hemlock and spruce trees, many of which are covered with hanging moss and ferns.","copyright":"Sunset at Ruby Beach in Olympic National Park, Washington state, USA (Â© Adam Mowery/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ruby+Beach+Olympic+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200425_2300%22","date":"20200425","image":{"name":"OHR.RubySunset_EN-GB3287075209.jpg","hd":"/images/47E6155E4642FFCD28ACE74769D99D60601B27C2793B3277492DFFAEE57B9B8C.jpg","tmb":"/images/9895750B510583758932DA59A7D2B27A6D6A39C8A6DB43BC9A03AF11C17DFAE4.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RubySunset_EN-GB3287075209_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RubySunset_EN-GB3287075209_tmb.jpg"}}
