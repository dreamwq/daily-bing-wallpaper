{"title":"Where the Romans struck gold","caption":"Where the Romans struck gold","desc":"The Romans certainly left their mark on this corner of northern Spain. Here in Las Médulas, in the province of León, the mountainous landscape was permanently transformed by at least 150 years of mining for gold. The Romans built a complex system of tunnels and canals and used running water to demolish the clay mountains and free the precious metal within. Once home to hundreds of tonnes of gold, it became the largest open air mine in the sprawling Roman Empire.","copyright":"Ancient Roman gold mining site of Las Médulas, León, Spain (© DEEPOL by plainpicture/David Santiago Garcia)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=las+m%c3%a9dulas+le%c3%b3n+region&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200410_2300%22","date":"20200410","image":{"name":"OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-GB8634431485.jpg","hd":"/images/6458EB01A2501B772897745DB1AB19EEBA4359A2B3DB4FF9B1997269DF5DD0F8.jpg","tmb":"/images/3B159073104FD7D522AC55AA5D89AD83B89CDBDFF33F4CC7E11BDD66303BCDDD.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-GB8634431485_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-GB8634431485_tmb.jpg"}}
