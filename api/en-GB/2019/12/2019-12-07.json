{"title":"A corking forest","caption":"Harvesting cork in Los Alcornocales","desc":"Los Alcornocales is one of Spain’s largest natural parks and is also home to the country’s largest population of cork oaks. This type of tree, the main source for most cork products, mainly grows in Mediterranean countries with plenty of sun and little rain. Cork is harvested once the tree is mature and it can then be stripped of its cork every decade. The trees are marked so as not to exploit the same ones repeatedly.","copyright":"Los Alcornocales forest, Málaga, Spain (© Andrés M.
