{"title":"It’s Giving Tuesday","caption":"It’s Giving Tuesday","desc":"By gifting his mate some prime nesting materials, we think this gentlemanly Atlantic puffin makes a fine mascot for Giving Tuesday. The event was established in the US in 2012 to encourage acts of generosity on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, at a time when consumerism seems to be the focus for so many. Giving Tuesday was started by a small non-profit organisation and with the help of social media campaigns, it has grown into a global movement. In 2018, Giving Tuesday participants raised about £310 million. Of course, you don't have to give money to participate. Organisers urge people to volunteer or take a cue from our homepage puffins and simply show a little kindness to each other. Now that's something we can all get behind (seabirds included).","copyright":"Male Atlantic puffin gives his mate nesting material, Skomer Island (© Danny Green/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Atlantic+Puffin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191203_0000%22","date":"20191203","image":{"name":"OHR.PuffinSharing_EN-GB6131729166.jpg","hd":"/images/57C29EDDFA903050DD044E02D1BA1CD262B4F0D8440E142E3FEC786761C1D8CF.jpg","tmb":"/images/30280F68146FD62D488B85C8A44EBBE6C594672A33FE359048F6D8DD7B7F0307.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PuffinSharing_EN-GB6131729166_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PuffinSharing_EN-GB6131729166_tmb.jpg"}}
