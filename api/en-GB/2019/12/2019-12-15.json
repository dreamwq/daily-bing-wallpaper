On the morning of 16 December 1944, the beleaguered German army threw its best remaining troops and armour against a lightly defended section of the Allied line. Bad weather grounded Allied air reconnaissance and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a 'bulge' in its drive west into Belgium.","copyright":"Luzulo-Fagetum beech forest covered with frost and snow, Ardennes, Belgium (© Philippe Moes/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=battle+of+the+bulge&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191215_0000%22","date":"20191215","image":{"name":"OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-GB7681565401.jpg","hd":"/images/1FF984B867106DE51A90FE503A0D08964B90B8496427EC84839514FC636CF71A.jpg","tmb":"/images/AF03CDE9C27F7BA76D2DBB27BCAD81DFA79587089E669D938570A3C56E6C569E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-GB7681565401_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-GB7681565401_tmb.jpg"}}
