Looking decidedly festive in our snowy shot, these majestic stags appear rusty red in the summer months but, come winter, their coats turn brown and thicken up (and who can blame them?). Stags’ antlers also increase in size as they get older and come into their own during the rut – the autumn breeding season – in testosterone-fuelled battles over females.","copyright":"Herd of red deer stags in a snow-covered pine forest, Cairngorms National Park (© Scotland: The Big Picture/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Red+deer+&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191214_0000%22","date":"20191214","image":{"name":"OHR.SnowStags_EN-GB9458043442.jpg","hd":"/images/2098D68B073DE9BDD226803FF9FA306BBFC2A9E1837DBF1B2B0287DD826F9748.jpg","tmb":"/images/CACA564D4BA0797BB9DC58B1F2301A2D98C6D44C75520906CBA36CE8D2006302.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowStags_EN-GB9458043442_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowStags_EN-GB9458043442_tmb.jpg"}}
