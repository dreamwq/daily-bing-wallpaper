Both white and black rhinos live in open savanna but adult rhinos’ only real predators are humans who hunt them for the illegal trade in their horns. Although they are large, tough animals, rhinos are an easy target for poachers during their daily visits to the watering hole.","copyright":"Two rhinos and an oxpecker bird in the Amakhala Game Reserve in South Africa (© Robert Harding World Imagery/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=southern+white+rhinoceros&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191204_0000%22","date":"20191204","image":{"name":"OHR.RhinosOxpecker_EN-GB6619996696.jpg","hd":"/images/0AB1D3BC05A7707BD547BBEA74F396AB51CEA815A9009E74F16EBC76E40D1F70.jpg","tmb":"/images/19EBB71B1B7A44268A2AC8BEFBE72043F692721E998499D1F50C0563A2148FCE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhinosOxpecker_EN-GB6619996696_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhinosOxpecker_EN-GB6619996696_tmb.jpg"}}
