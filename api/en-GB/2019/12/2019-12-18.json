{"title":"It’s Weihnachtsmarkt time!","caption":"It’s Weihnachtsmarkt time!","desc":"The streets of this market square are all decked out in a tradition which started nearly 700 years ago. Weihnachtsmarkts or Christkindlmarkts (Christmas markets, if you prefer less of a mouthful), take place around the world but they originated in Germany as a celebratory way to observe Advent, the Christian season leading up to Christmas Eve. These markets are generally open-air attractions where everything is decorated, including the trees (called Tannenbaums in German, if they're firs).","copyright":"Annual Schwäbisch Hall Weihnachtsmarkt in the market square, Baden-Württemberg, Germany (© sack/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=schwaebisch+hall&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191218_0000%22","date":"20191218","image":{"name":"OHR.HallXmasMarket_EN-GB5889641569.jpg","hd":"/images/942E8418CFC55B5283F105BD225DB634A60C470D01596281002A8DFADCD9E882.jpg","tmb":"/images/CE02F9B278041E92EA3B6495DB3897E7BF91EFCB958D213B0A92372A34B3731D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HallXmasMarket_EN-GB5889641569_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HallXmasMarket_EN-GB5889641569_tmb.jpg"}}
