{"title":"The shortest day","caption":"Seeing in the winter solstice","desc":"We’re marking the winter solstice here on the Hebridean Isle of Lewis, where the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones (or Calanais Stones in Gaelic), provide an atmospheric backdrop as the sun rises and sets on the shortest day of the year. There’s some debate about why these Scottish megaliths, which predate Stonehenge by at least two millennia, are there in the first place. But whether they were intended as an astronomical observatory or a place of rituals and religious observances,  they are a great place to watch the sun, moon and, on occasion, the Northern Lights.","copyright":"The Callanish Stones, Isle of Lewis, at sunset (© Neil MacConnell/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Winter+Solstice&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191222_0000%22","date":"20191222","image":{"name":"OHR.CallanishStones_EN-GB9649596796.jpg","hd":"/images/314D738234C1D74610237DA6A2D0854AED99DF76AD2B6763E8B91F8BEED1D524.jpg","tmb":"/images/5466718A9DF0AAB13FAAC2C642E4F9746A37E24FE9E10AB31C6ADB4A50711D3D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CallanishStones_EN-GB9649596796_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CallanishStones_EN-GB9649596796_tmb.jpg"}}
