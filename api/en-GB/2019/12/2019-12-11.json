{"title":"The high life","caption":"In the Himalayas for International Mountain Day","desc":"The summit of Ama Dablam rises up behind Tengboche Monastery, a Tibetan Buddhist site more than 12,000ft above sea level. Ama Dablam means mother's necklace: Its swooping shape is thought to resemble a mother cradling a child while a dangling glacier on its south-west face has been likened to the religious pendants many Sherpa women wear. The monastery is a stop on the Sacred Sites Trail Project, a self-guided trek through holy places in Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park.","copyright":"Tengboche Monastery in the Himalayan Mountains, Nepal (Â© Kyle Hammons/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=tengboche+monastery+nepal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191211_0000%22","date":"20191211","image":{"name":"OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-GB1072390381.jpg","hd":"/images/352684D35DAFD035F76596330004388668D45740BA71E26ABBDE4C10B3153E76.jpg","tmb":"/images/FD9F2A4F5FE45F4AC4A265131DE1A75BE9E37AC9E46BE4568A3F571B4AA82D98.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-GB1072390381_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-GB1072390381_tmb.jpg"}}
