{"title":"Festive stress?","caption":"Festive stress or flirting?","desc":"The run-up to Christmas can be a bit stressful, as demonstrated by our two gentoo penguins in Antarctica, who appear to be getting things off their chests. Or perhaps they are simply participating in the tongue-in-cheek observance Festivus – popularised by the US comedy Seinfeld. Made up by American writer Daniel O’Keefe, it was rebranded as a rejection of Christmas-season commercialism  in a 1997 episode of the sitcom, complete with alternative traditions such as the ‘Airing of Grievances’. Having said that, gentoo penguins mainly use their signature trumpeting call in mating rituals – so it’s perfectly possible these two lovebirds are on a date. Anyway, happy Festivus! Or Christmas Eve Eve, if you prefer.","copyright":"Gentoo penguins airing grievances in Antarctica (© Grafissimo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gentoo+penguin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191223_0000%22","date":"20191223","image":{"name":"OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-GB2301817471.jpg","hd":"/images/84DACA46DF1A1B26500ADBD0272CA90CD639D6FB68070C966405C8C184DD9D22.jpg","tmb":"/images/0AB5043A04DA0D742000234DF57F9A6F444D0F0B536EB4F66F7919CADF0CED2B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-GB2301817471_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-GB2301817471_tmb.jpg"}}
