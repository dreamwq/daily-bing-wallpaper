{"title":"3, 2, 1 … Happy New Year!","caption":"3, 2, 1 … Happy New Year!","desc":"Backnang, the town celebrating the new year in this photo, is in Germany's Baden region. Thanks to the Rhine River on the west and the Black Forest to the east, the soil in Baden is ideal for vineyards. Among the varieties of wine produced here, Spätburgunder is common, which you may know by its French name: Pinot Noir. The people of Backnang may well be celebrating with a glass of Pinot or something else this evening. But however you choose to celebrate, here's wishing you a very happy and healthy new year!","copyright":"Fireworks for New Year's Eve in Backnang, Germany (© Lilly/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=New+Year%27s+Eve&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191231_0000%22","date":"20191231","image":{"name":"OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-GB0230157264.jpg","hd":"/images/75D13FA36B8C55B594C457062106AA59269794464A900390AED31CC07F1C36B5.jpg","tmb":"/images/9429EF86E7D5F5EB247A5882DEBF9340AE5A210257631A915BA35617FD81DAD0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-GB0230157264_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-GB0230157264_tmb.jpg"}}
