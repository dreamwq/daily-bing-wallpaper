{"title":"Remember remember","caption":"Remember remember the 5th of November","desc":"Leeds Castle provides the backdrop for our homepage to mark this year’s Bonfire Night - or Guy Fawkes Night - celebrations. The picturesque castle is nowhere near Leeds, Yorkshire but is situated near the village of the same name in Kent, in the south east of England. Built on two islands in a lake, it is celebrating its 900th anniversary this year, during which time it has served as a Norman stronghold, as home to six queens, a Jacobean country home and a Georgian mansion.","copyright":"Bonfire Night fireworks, Leeds Castle, Kent (© Franz-Marc Frei/Corbis Documentary/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=bonfire+night+guy+fawkes&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191105_0000%22","date":"20191105","image":{"name":"OHR.FireworksLeeds_EN-GB6428897652.jpg","hd":"/images/D31F4C2C881885E1EA130F594DA46CE9E28F2C4106A05B42B2C90E7BB67CD84C.jpg","tmb":"/images/408BEE2AEDFDD5C697FA4403A5660C17CA258B8EEA7EF239C84F2A9ED5748696.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FireworksLeeds_EN-GB6428897652_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FireworksLeeds_EN-GB6428897652_tmb.jpg"}}
