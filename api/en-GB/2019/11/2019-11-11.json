{"title":"Remembrance Day","caption":"Remembering the fallen","desc":"There have been some spectacular remembrance artworks in recent years as the centenary of World War One approached – including more than 800,000 ceramic poppies cascading out of the Tower of London in 2014. Today’s picture shows part of a more transient installation from 2018, the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice. Thirty giant sand portraits of people who died during the war appeared briefly on 30 beaches across the UK’s coastline – only to be washed away again, when the tide came in.","copyright":"Sand portrait of WW1 Royal Naval Reservist Richard Davies on Ynyslas Beach, Ceredigion  (© Keith Morris Aerial Imagery/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Remembrance+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191111_0000%22","date":"20191111","image":{"name":"OHR.YnyslasRemembrance_EN-GB0347607342.jpg","hd":"/images/DD52E7CA070E92F298F9FC05A0203F81CCBD2C551BEBDA8E6F38E2E3FB6056E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/29B213D9194C38121E041D9EF4FCEC7A5B96CB532606B1284F1A9FC3F4499755.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YnyslasRemembrance_EN-GB0347607342_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YnyslasRemembrance_EN-GB0347607342_tmb.jpg"}}
