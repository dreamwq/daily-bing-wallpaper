{"title":"It's Beaujolais Nouveau Day!","caption":"Le Beaujolais Nouveau est arrivé!","desc":"'Bring us some fresh wine! The freshest you've got - this year! No more of this old stuff.' Steve Martin was joking when his character in The Jerk asked for fresh wine - or could he have been talking about Beaujolais Nouveau? The red wine, produced in France’s Beaujolais region, is fermented for just a few weeks and doesn’t need to be aged in barrels before it's sold, from the third Thursday of every November. It’s a light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. South of Burgundy, the Beaujolais region has a relatively warm climate so Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir and other famous French grapes don't grow well there. But the fruity grape variety Gamay grows vigorously in Beaujolais and is used to make Beaujolais Nouveau.","copyright":"Lantignié in the Beaujolais region of France (© Jon Arnold/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=beaujolais+nouveau&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191121_0000%22","date":"20191121","image":{"name":"OHR.BeaujolaisRegion_EN-GB2038627942.jpg","hd":"/images/3977A924D9DA5017F980F99C042FCCDA56F120C4A3648F9F872FF592DD3DFEC2.jpg","tmb":"/images/AFE9DD9E6A4BF752A04BA7A2A8B21B959DBBA954F9C5462BA8C931414CA8FC45.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeaujolaisRegion_EN-GB2038627942_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeaujolaisRegion_EN-GB2038627942_tmb.jpg"}}
