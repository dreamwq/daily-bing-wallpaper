{"title":"The Cutty Sark turns 150","caption":"The Cutty Sark turns 150","desc":"We're featuring the Cutty Sark in today's image to mark the 150th anniversary of her launch on 22 November 1869. Built for speed, she began her short career as a tea clipper racing across oceans 'at a clip' to deliver the season's first tea harvest to England. While at times the Cutty Sark was considered one of the fastest ships in the world, her practical use as a cargo ship was ending almost as soon as she was launched. Steamships using the much shorter route through the newly opened Suez Canal were able to deliver the tea harvest faster and cheaper. In 1883, the Cutty Sark began hauling wool from Australia, but within 10 years steamships also disrupted this business.","copyright":"The Cutty Sark in Greenwich, London for her 150th anniversary (Â© Grant Rooney Premium/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=cutty+sark+museum+greenwich&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191122_0000%22","date":"20191122","image":{"name":"OHR.CuttySark150_EN-GB4058544963.jpg","hd":"/images/2EAFE24AE662E0D9186012E96FE4BA7E115C455F4662B2566D0AE32B983B0F8B.jpg","tmb":"/images/34420B1C68695D5E91F2D902F2CF08D70E4074E841FCCC005A05E54BC7ABE147.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuttySark150_EN-GB4058544963_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuttySark150_EN-GB4058544963_tmb.jpg"}}
