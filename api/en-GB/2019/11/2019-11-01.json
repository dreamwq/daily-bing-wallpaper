{"title":"Silent hunter","caption":"Active at night, camouflaged in the day","desc":"Great Horned Owls are slick and silent hunters most commonly found in the Americas. They are adaptable birds with habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to the Arctic tundra and they can survive in woods as well as suburbia. Great Horned Owls target relatively large creatures such as rabbits, raccoons, squirrels and skunks. Their distinctive features make them easy to identify, look out for their bright yellow eyes, long fluffy feathers and curved beaks. Keep a safe distance though, as they are fiercely protective of their young and can attack those who come too close. For now, we’ll just admire this nocturnal bird from afar.","copyright":"Great Horned Owl sitting on an Aspen tree, Alberta, Canada (© Ambre Haller/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=great+horned+owl&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191101_0000%22","date":"20191101","image":{"name":"OHR.AlbertaOwl_EN-GB9855083148.jpg","hd":"/images/E691E52F85B63AC3F02C4443845A12AFF2CADF8DD777312DC86CC9D95C2C9F18.jpg","tmb":"/images/08E09F3A6DC02DA87DED8E2DDA74369C7A95E431447E76FD489E69E16EC2ACAB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlbertaOwl_EN-GB9855083148_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlbertaOwl_EN-GB9855083148_tmb.jpg"}}
