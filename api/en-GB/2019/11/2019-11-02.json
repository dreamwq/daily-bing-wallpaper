{"title":"The Lady of the Woods","caption":"The Lady of the Woods","desc":"Silver birch trees like these in Craigellachie National Nature Reserve have long been celebrated as symbols of purity and rebirth. In early Celtic mythology, bundles of their twigs were used to drive out spirits of the old year while in Scottish Highlands folklore it was believed that a barren cow herded with a birch stick would become fertile. Known as the “lady of the woods”, the old Gaelic word for birch, beith, can be found in some Scottish place names – the same goes for birk in England and bedw in Wales.","copyright":"Silver birch (Betula pendula) woodland, Craigellachie National Nature Reserve, Scotland (© Nature Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=craigellachie+nature+reserve+birch&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191102_0000%22","date":"20191102","image":{"name":"OHR.SilverBirch_EN-GB5075805778.jpg","hd":"/images/DF151F940738F1741BC8D8FD12D1CF37A46F7E04FDCD28DFD467B1A08F8B505F.jpg","tmb":"/images/AF6726A0BC7B7CC311AB1DE7B49E72D00A6F1C1D23CEAB602EF809531F28F024.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SilverBirch_EN-GB5075805778_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SilverBirch_EN-GB5075805778_tmb.jpg"}}
