{"title":"Autumn in the cypress swamp","caption":"Autumn in the cypress swamp","desc":"Autumn still brings a splash of colour to the cypress forest here in the Atchafalaya Basin, the largest river swamp in the US. These bald cypress trees thrive in the swamps of America’s Deep South because they are naturally water-resistant - their wood has been used for centuries in construction, particularly roofing. But admiring their changing colours here in Louisiana is an adventure in itself. The swamp forest floor is often covered by the waters of Atchafalaya River as it drains into the Gulf of Mexico, so changing leaves are best viewed from a canoe, known as a pirogue by local Cajuns.","copyright":"A cypress tree in the Atchafalaya Basin, Louisiana, USA (© Chris Moore/Tandem Still + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=atchafalaya+basin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191124_0000%22","date":"20191124","image":{"name":"OHR.AtchafalayaCypress_EN-GB5565439339.jpg","hd":"/images/E64D7BCB5D49DCC5925FD2CEE7D1FC2C77895A95788F088A47FC70806ED6CB9B.jpg","tmb":"/images/8CD6E788C758C218AFA53E6873BC80BC552EB1ECC6E1E5147FE28CFD0DC6D887.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AtchafalayaCypress_EN-GB5565439339_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AtchafalayaCypress_EN-GB5565439339_tmb.jpg"}}
