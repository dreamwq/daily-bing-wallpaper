{"title":"Chapel on the rock","caption":"Chapel on the rock","desc":"Pace yourselves! You’ll need to climb 268 stone steps to reach the entrance of Chapel St-Michel d’Aiguilhe (Chapel of St Michael of the Needle). This historic church, near Le Puy-en-Velay in France, is a Unesco World Heritage Site which was constructed in 969 by a local bishop and dedicated to Archangel Michael. It had spiritual significance even before that, as it was home to prehistoric dolmen (stone tombs) built by the Romans to honour their god, Mercury. The huge rock it sits on is actually a volcanic plug, created when magma hardens inside a volcano’s vent. The region’s volcanic soil is also thought to contribute to the peppery flavour of its famous Le Puy green lentils.","copyright":"Chapel St-Michel d'Aiguilhe, Le Puy-en-Velay, France (© Jaubert French Collection/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Chapel+St-Michel+d%27+Aiguilhe&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191108_0000%22","date":"20191108","image":{"name":"OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-GB2367743010.jpg","hd":"/images/B09A1019AB3F28F61C297D9314491F5FC89EEF31DE62F78BE139DE1CB9C23558.jpg","tmb":"/images/D702AE86B683A1BD909473CBA2425C2047F480C7C7CFEF9B09F2A87F96870844.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-GB2367743010_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-GB2367743010_tmb.jpg"}}
