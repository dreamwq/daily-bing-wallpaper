{"title":"St Andrew's Day","caption":"A misty Saltire for St Andrew’s Day","desc":"These low-lying clouds reflected in Loch Chon have created a misty Saltire – the perfect picture to see in St Andrew's Day and celebrate Scotland’s patron saint. Today, 30 November, marks the start of Scotland’s three winter festivals – the others being Hogmanay and Burns Night – and is celebrated with traditional food and drink, music and dancing. St Andrew is patron saint of a number of countries including Russia and Romania and there are various stories about how he ended up being patron saint of Scotland. One involves a 9th Century king of the Picts, Oengus II, who saw white clouds form an “X” in the sky before battle against the Angles – a bit like our homepage image today. It was taken as a sign and he vowed that if he won the battle, he would make St Andrew the patron saint of Scotland. He did!","copyright":"Low-lying cloud over Loch Chon, the Trossachs, for St Andrew's Day   (© Alistair Dick/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=St+Andrew%27s+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191130_0000%22","date":"20191130","image":{"name":"OHR.SaltireClouds_EN-GB1504522042.jpg","hd":"/images/B75BADCAAE0B8A6F3700D4DF51013BFF0374A5F32AD8C66850933402A51B8D5D.jpg","tmb":"/images/60307FEEE478539CEC6EF93393C64CBD86A9B8702DE09E7453CB63D950843312.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaltireClouds_EN-GB1504522042_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaltireClouds_EN-GB1504522042_tmb.jpg"}}
