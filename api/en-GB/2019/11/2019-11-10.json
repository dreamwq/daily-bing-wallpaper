{"title":"Nature’s beautiful blanket","caption":"Springtime spreads across Alpine National Park","desc":"While autumn turns to winter in the UK, it is decidedly more spring-like in Australia at this time of year. Expect colours aplenty in Alpine National Park in the state of Victoria, as new life is breathed into this stunning landscape. The park’s mountain peaks and grassy high plains are home to a wide variety of vegetation, largely from the alpine and subalpine family although snow gums and alpine ash trees are also known to litter the forest. During the springtime, you may even be lucky enough to see snow daisies and bright wildflowers spread across the ground in a colourful blanket, much like they are in today’s image.","copyright":"Wildflowers in the mist on Mount Howitt in Alpine National Park, Victoria, Australia (© Australian Scenics/Photolibrary/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Alpine+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191110_0000%22","date":"20191110","image":{"name":"OHR.MountHowitt_EN-GB9296815485.jpg","hd":"/images/1A9940995CDDF522A69C015AE6E5B784439E5EBA934CE095660AD9A71953DD3F.jpg","tmb":"/images/73EBDE7ACCF3F4E8D099738AEE294FB17868AC02D02F1321EF758B6AAD343A36.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountHowitt_EN-GB9296815485_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountHowitt_EN-GB9296815485_tmb.jpg"}}
