{"title":"Light the night","caption":"The perfect canvas for an ancient text","desc":"Since 2009, the city of Durham has served as the backdrop for the biennial Lumiere Durham festival. During four days in November, works of 'son et lumière' (French for sound and light) create new ways of seeing public spaces and buildings. Artists from around the world design large-scale light shows complete with sound effects here in the north east of England. It's become the UK's largest light festival and Lumiere Durham's 10th anniversary, which begins today, promises to attract more than 200,000 people to enjoy the illuminated artworks along cobbled streets.","copyright":"The Crown of Light installation at Durham Cathedral, during the 2013 Lumiere Durham festival (© Stuart Forster/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Durham+Cathedral+england&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191114_0000%22","date":"20191114","image":{"name":"OHR.CrownofLight_EN-GB2085738805.jpg","hd":"/images/BEC052641090E7BFD8BE1994CD7A9F2E19C058EA95AE2B4D74287E628D0A208A.jpg","tmb":"/images/ED36314C4D15EEE912262FB045BB571C1DD929719B9B188B9263156A3C5B5983.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrownofLight_EN-GB2085738805_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrownofLight_EN-GB2085738805_tmb.jpg"}}
