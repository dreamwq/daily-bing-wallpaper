{"title":"Mesmerising murmuration","caption":"Mesmerising murmuration","desc":"As temperatures dip here in the Northern Hemisphere, flocks of starlings – known as a murmuration - put on a dazzling show. These noisy birds can be seen as a bit of a pest, due to their bullying behaviour at the birdfeeder. But in autumn and winter months, British starling populations are swelled by millions of others seeking warmer temperatures and they gather to roost in huge flocks at sites across the country - like these ones, in Blackpool, north west England.","copyright":"Starlings at sunset in Blackpool (© Mediaworld Images/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=starlings&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191115_0000%22","date":"20191115","image":{"name":"OHR.Murmurations_EN-GB2559808619.jpg","hd":"/images/1ACE0187FB2C9116E4E72F0AF6889D77805DD4FC5FF8F444B0829B798B42E10B.jpg","tmb":"/images/2088E969C9002F66603FE800795D5D25FC238545A77E8E5F0C6C419552E90C0B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Murmurations_EN-GB2559808619_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Murmurations_EN-GB2559808619_tmb.jpg"}}
