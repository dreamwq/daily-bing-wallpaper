It’s on the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route and its real name is Aguas Santas (Holy Waters) beach. It’s known as Las Catedrales because its arches, thought to have been carved by the action of salty water and wind over millions of years, look like the buttresses of a Catholic church.","copyright":"Las Catedrales beach, Galicia, Spain (© Davide Seddio/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=As+Catedrais+beach&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191128_0000%22","date":"20191128","image":{"name":"OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-GB9414583978.jpg","hd":"/images/737A2B12534FEF2C4D09E725A6A6A1387C646500FA835CDAEA8E4F65B4022A57.jpg","tmb":"/images/FB322F791810F02D955674866014B0CB4202D4D132766909EEFC15B118AC404E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-GB9414583978_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-GB9414583978_tmb.jpg"}}
