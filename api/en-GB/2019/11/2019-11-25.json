{"title":"The migrating monarchs of Michoacán","caption":"The migrating monarchs of Michoacán","desc":"Every autumn, millions of these striking monarch butterflies embark on one of the world’s most amazing migrations from North America to the mountains of western Mexico. They travel up to 3,000 miles south on air currents - a huge distance for these delicate insects, to a place none of them has been to before. And unlike migratory birds, these particular butterflies will never return to the north – they simply won’t live long enough.","copyright":"Monarch butterflies wintering in Michoacán, Mexico (© Sylvain Cordier/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=monarch+butterfly&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191125_0000%22","date":"20191125","image":{"name":"OHR.OverwinteringMonarchs_EN-GB5931365974.jpg","hd":"/images/69AE9B40FA8358751770642D989FCF01180B6AE180B9AF12571D67A6507547E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/BA688438A6BC330C9DD4C82931CEB5974FC03BFC8421F806762890DC4CCEBC49.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OverwinteringMonarchs_EN-GB5931365974_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OverwinteringMonarchs_EN-GB5931365974_tmb.jpg"}}
