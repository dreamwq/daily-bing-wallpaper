Here in Marrakesh, Morocco, souks (or markets) like this one in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different takes on traditional Moroccan food.","copyright":"Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh, Morocco (Â© Pavliha/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jemaa+el-Fnaa+Square&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191127_0000%22","date":"20191127","image":{"name":"OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-GB8735691094.jpg","hd":"/images/E3938A744D9073066AA45D87569B2F22238054208346E8BA65057AB6FBB7ECCB.jpg","tmb":"/images/78284074A094818475C31050B435A293384FC13D6A0BA88A17E2AC9C88C70C86.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-GB8735691094_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-GB8735691094_tmb.jpg"}}
