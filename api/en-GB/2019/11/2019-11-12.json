{"title":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","caption":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","desc":"As the cooler weather sets in, hedgehogs are preparing to hibernate. Most begin in October or early November and remain in that state until springtime. During hibernation, an animal's heart rate and breathing slow and its body temperature drops. However, of all native UK mammals, only the hedgehog, dormouse and various bat species hibernate. Others – like badgers – will become less active as they survive on reserves of body fat, so although you see less of them, they are not actually hibernating.","copyright":"Baby hedgehog (© lorenzo104/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=hedgehogs&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191112_0000%22","date":"20191112","image":{"name":"OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-GB1053695179.jpg","hd":"/images/7BA7AE8F9236F0C0FFBE84B3468AC78A4D25F092D211D872974FA76B421E0CEB.jpg","tmb":"/images/AE313B31E16FEB3127F2ECB75DFFA4CE86802D69C79A6D4ECED96B2BE11F0951.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-GB1053695179_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-GB1053695179_tmb.jpg"}}
