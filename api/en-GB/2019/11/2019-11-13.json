Nazaré began attracting surfers in the 1960s and has become a major destination for men and women who want to surf some of the world's biggest waves. Nazaré's Praia do Norte (North Beach) is the site of the two most recent records for the largest wave ever surfed. The previous record was set by American Garrett McNamara on 1 November 2011, when he rode a 78ft wave here. Then, on 8 November 2017, Koxa set a new record with this ride.","copyright":"Rodrigo Koxa riding the biggest wave ever surfed, on 8 Nov 2017, off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal (© Pedro Cruz/AP Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=nazare+surfing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191113_0000%22","date":"20191113","image":{"name":"OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-GB1474317902.jpg","hd":"/images/A6632EFB3C4627C5EF1388B069E54FF7BE6877D16453CBE93A70C74C86FD637A.jpg","tmb":"/images/480D4789B105335F1F360A217F0A2212BFD46B0D3713263CA0039401F00B3AE6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-GB1474317902_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-GB1474317902_tmb.jpg"}}
