{"title":"Purple haze","caption":"Bloom time for the Jacaranda","desc":"Although Australia enjoys a wide variety of plant life, the Jacaranda is without question one of the most beloved. Commonly mistaken as a local species by Australians, the Jacaranda’s roots actually lie in Brazil. In around 1818, samples of the Jacaranda mimosifolia species were collected and sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew by British collector Allan Cunningham. He was then sent on from Rio de Janeiro to New South Wales, where he would eventually serve as a colonial botanist.","copyright":"Blooming jacaranda trees in New Farm Park, Brisbane, Australia (© Walter Bibikow/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jacaranda+Trees&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190927_2300%22","date":"20190927","image":{"name":"OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-GB9346746091.jpg","hd":"/images/37444948F46028262D58859FDA8BF0E5680C6C83A3E7B9494B45CF864D865EB0.jpg","tmb":"/images/1053C1F011C7E20FE182C3189CD22BCB4504480EE3650AA6DAFFE2FCD53A03E6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-GB9346746091_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-GB9346746091_tmb.jpg"}}
