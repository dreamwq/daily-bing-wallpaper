{"title":"Greetings from Asbury Park","caption":"Greetings from Asbury Park","desc":"The warm waters of the Atlantic and a long stretch of sand bring thousands of visitors, but Asbury Park, located on the US east coast, also draws waves of art, culture and music that shine brightly in the summer months. Bruce Springsteen grew up in the area and has played here regularly since the 1970s. The American rock icon clearly finds this place special – the name of his 1973 album inspired the title for today’s image. But the rich history of the music scene predates ‘The Boss’, with the sounds of jazz, gospel and rhythm and blues spilling out from clubs dating back to the 1920s, when the area was developed as a seaside community.","copyright":"Asbury Park in New Jersey, USA (© Patrick Morisson/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=asbury+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190908_2300%22","date":"20190908","image":{"name":"OHR.AsburyParkNJ_EN-GB9284980454.jpg","hd":"/images/0A0482EC70189873522EE29B4BB8A578620282C11BAFABC4B1325A7CEFE89FA8.jpg","tmb":"/images/7A53BD28FE4D670855C12CF232EF8A12371ADCE37A50E24D6258B5539EFE8FAB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AsburyParkNJ_EN-GB9284980454_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AsburyParkNJ_EN-GB9284980454_tmb.jpg"}}
