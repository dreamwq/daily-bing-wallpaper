{"title":"Astrotourism at its finest","caption":"Astrotourism at its finest","desc":"Stay in Canyonlands National Park until after sunset so you can appreciate one of the park's most distinct features – a night sky so free of human-generated light that it’s been designated a \"gold tier\" International Dark Sky Park. When you’re in the city you may see up to 500 stars in a moonless night sky, but here in Canyonlands, in the US state of Utah, you can see more than 15,000. Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above. But for those who follow the Sun, daytime is perfect for hiking and camping, wildlife viewing and discovering rock drawings and markings left behind by prehistoric people.","copyright":"The Milky Way seen from Canyonlands National Park in Utah, USA (© Cavan Images/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=canyonlands+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190911_2300%22","date":"20190911","image":{"name":"OHR.MilkyWayCanyonlands_EN-GB7152651724.jpg","hd":"/images/063C481525FACDB5339DA5F4F57553FD58EAC2DD0FFB4789B03D9489D5520950.jpg","tmb":"/images/58D7033924BA6586100BF5B7685AC9CE6EF5E753286B8FB9CFB2B614FE6D330C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MilkyWayCanyonlands_EN-GB7152651724_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MilkyWayCanyonlands_EN-GB7152651724_tmb.jpg"}}
