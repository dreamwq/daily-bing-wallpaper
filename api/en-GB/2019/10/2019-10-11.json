What makes this race so unusual, and so popular, is that it's open to both professional and amateur sailors. Since the first race in 1969, which attracted 51 boats, it's been drawing increasing numbers of sailors and spectators to Trieste each year.","copyright":"Boats massing for the Barcolana Regatta in the Gulf of Trieste, Italy (Â© Ababsolutum/E+/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Barcolana+Regatta&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191011_2300%22","date":"20191011","image":{"name":"OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-GB2444428412.jpg","hd":"/images/084E40F4F3F0A06117A00DD74192AB9C5CBB58769B9D0DE6D4E408684F73DACC.jpg","tmb":"/images/3D5D65C6FE723E185557A436AEBEE3F23601F6F11EC2890011550687782C26E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-GB2444428412_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-GB2444428412_tmb.jpg"}}
