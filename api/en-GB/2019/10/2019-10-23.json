{"title":"A bridge built to last","caption":"A bridge built to last","desc":"The County Bridge has offered a picturesque passage over the Contoocook River in the US state of New Hampshire since 1937. Why build a covered bridge? In a word, longevity. The roof and walls help protect the timber supports from rot. By comparison, an uncovered wooden bridge lasts an average of 20 years, while the covered variety can reach 100 years or more.","copyright":"County Bridge in New Hampshire, USA (Â© Denis Tangney Jr/E+/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Covered+bridge&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191023_2300%22","date":"20191023","image":{"name":"OHR.CountyBridge_EN-GB4201485106.jpg","hd":"/images/63A3E533FE71E15F74CA679ABF775BB468A1A4020B08595641BAD473BE1CCA3D.jpg","tmb":"/images/B06846C3C7F5C7F34A4477BAA1D89F8E0895BB3A6F3B5508E7F13747E24FF6A2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CountyBridge_EN-GB4201485106_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CountyBridge_EN-GB4201485106_tmb.jpg"}}
