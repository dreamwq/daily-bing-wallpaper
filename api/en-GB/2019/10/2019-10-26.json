But like The Doctor, today we're all time travellers. This morning we ‘fell back’ in time (or will fall back for those reading this before 2am) by one hour, for the end of British Summer Time (BST). And as with changes to whoever plays The Doctor, this change isn't without controversy. Since the 1970s, many studies have tried to quantify the advantages or disadvantages that come with falling back and springing forward, as yet there's no definitive answer on whether or not it is better or worse for us.","copyright":"Workers cleaning the clock face of Big Ben, London (© Reuters)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=daylight+saving+time+UK&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191026_2300%22","date":"20191026","image":{"name":"OHR.AbseilersBigBen_EN-GB2133111846.jpg","hd":"/images/D4F1D8A1A436591CD8FE8427B9D12639A748012377CDB364B1123FE9D2F94980.jpg","tmb":"/images/028BAFA6B332E51AE2F1512A1E875B15EE7C9FB3E39E9C7AFB8A0B717135C1E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbseilersBigBen_EN-GB2133111846_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbseilersBigBen_EN-GB2133111846_tmb.jpg"}}
