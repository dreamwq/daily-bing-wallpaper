These large bats pack into a small area to roost but when the sun begins to set, they start to swarm, darkening the skies as they fly off to gorge on fruit in the Mushitu swamp forest. No wonder they are hungry - their migration is thought to begin 2,000 miles north, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.","copyright":"Straw-coloured fruit bats in Kasanka National Park, Zambia (© Nick Garbutt/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=straw-coloured+fruit+bats+kasanka+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191029_0000%22","date":"20191029","image":{"name":"OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-GB3378237414.jpg","hd":"/images/2022C0AC86BDC24192E252F3994D78D048EDFBB3B440BE1A5093F795D2A6F0E9.jpg","tmb":"/images/A45FFADE7825BA2EAB3999EF8FB1DA9DE338C4A7B784FE2F17AC4D8620C444B0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-GB3378237414_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-GB3378237414_tmb.jpg"}}
