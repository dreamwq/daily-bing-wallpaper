{"title":"Clinging on","caption":"Hanging on by a (byssal) thread","desc":"These colourful common, or blue, mussels, clinging to rocks as the tide goes out will be a familiar sight to those who’ve gone rockpooling on beaches all around the UK coast. These little guys use silky but very strong fibres called byssal threads – sometimes referred to as beards – to attach themselves to rocks and hang on against strong currents and crashing waves. Alongside oysters, mussels are a big part of the UK’s shellfish industry. Blue mussels are common on UK shores and are also farmed here, often grown on ropes dangling from rafts in clean waters.","copyright":"Colony of Common Mussels (Mytilus edulis) growing on striated rock formation exposed at low tide.
