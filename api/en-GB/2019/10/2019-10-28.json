It’s the Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum in the US state of Oregon - a collection of abandoned buildings from the area. In the late 19th and early 20th Century, people acquired government land for farms and ranches via the Homestead Acts. But most left within a few years due to the hot, dry summers and extremely cold winters. Today, the buildings are assembled as a ghost town and contain items from that period, including furniture, dishes and tools. There's also a nearby cemetery which, according to local lore, is haunted by the ghost of rancher and author Reub Long riding his horse.","copyright":"Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum, Oregon, USA (© Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Fort+Rock+Valley+Historical+Homestead+Museum&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191028_0000%22","date":"20191028","image":{"name":"OHR.FortRockHomestead_EN-GB2635203541.jpg","hd":"/images/3C734C44BF4EB42229768DBC9BD86F22E4E66213A11FF4C7BE16BFA1CC90A0A0.jpg","tmb":"/images/742FD316699C84EA6F11A5356D16B27134D375F60F597CE867364018FA3AFE4B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FortRockHomestead_EN-GB2635203541_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FortRockHomestead_EN-GB2635203541_tmb.jpg"}}
