{"title":"Hidden depths","caption":"Land ho in New Zealand 250 years ago","desc":"We're looking at Marlborough Sounds, a network of ancient sunken river valleys at the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island. It was 250 years ago that New Zealand was spotted by British explorer Captain James Cook from the HMS Endeavour. The main purpose of Cook’s voyage to the Pacific was to sail to Tahiti and observe the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun. Only after completing this task did Cook unseal the rest of his orders and learn he was to search the South Pacific for signs of a fabled great southern continent, Terra Australis Incognito.","copyright":"Aerial view of Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand (© Mathias Ortmann/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Marlborough+Sounds+New+Zealand&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191005_2300%22","date":"20191005","image":{"name":"OHR.MarlboroughSounds_EN-GB5442703733.jpg","hd":"/images/34DFE82DC79A39A66C97BE5F50C33159E8D9EE71250919BF2F6FA8682EA8C720.jpg","tmb":"/images/B8BF5E1D6CEBD774FCB4140F374BF6E7417532DC6975333530839C5C85E6D19D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarlboroughSounds_EN-GB5442703733_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarlboroughSounds_EN-GB5442703733_tmb.jpg"}}
