{"title":"Love on ice","caption":"Looking for love on ice","desc":"There’s love in the air here in Antarctica, where these Adélie penguins have come together after a long winter at sea. October brings them ashore in search of their breeding grounds. Here they’ll pair up and expand their families, gathering in large colonies of thousands and constructing nests made of stones piled together on the shoreline. Love can be a cruel game, and these penguins are known to steal stones from other nests.","copyright":"Adélie penguins at Possession Island, Antarctica (© Tui De Roy/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=adelie+penguins&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191001_2300%22","date":"20191001","image":{"name":"OHR.AdelieBreeding_EN-GB4932004342.jpg","hd":"/images/6D6E3F5B1A675A21E2D0BAF6078654783EACD7A7A61EDCFD6D3A11C4C5D1CC97.jpg","tmb":"/images/2E52F1AB9891B2FB20E9FF28E9870699DF28CBB4677973CF032ACDEFF44D0A6B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AdelieBreeding_EN-GB4932004342_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AdelieBreeding_EN-GB4932004342_tmb.jpg"}}
