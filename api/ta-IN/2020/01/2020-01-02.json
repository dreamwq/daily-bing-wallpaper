Titled 'Field of Light,' it's currently on display in the United States at a venue called Sensorio in Paso Robles, California, the latest stop in a tour of sites around the world. At Sensorio, a new arts centre that bills itself as representing 'the intersection of art, technology and nature,' visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibres, that change colour. When the sun sets, the fibres illuminate, creating a shimmering, interactive landscape in the meadow. The art installation changes a bit at each destination, but Munro tells reporters, 'the one constant is that it does make people smile.'","copyright":"'Field of Light at Sensorio,' by Bruce Munro, Paso Robles, California, USA.
