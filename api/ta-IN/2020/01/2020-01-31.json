{"title":"Amber Fort near Jaipur, Rajastha","caption":"Amber Fort near Jaipur, Rajastha","desc":"Amber, also known as Amer, is a little town just 4 kilometres in radius, located 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Perched on a hill overlooking the Maota Lake, Amer Fort and Palace is strategically located for battle. Today it is one of the principal tourist attractions of the area. The fort is known for its artistic style elements, series of gates and cobbled pathways within.  One striking feature of the fort is the ‘Sukh Nivas’, where an ancient ‘air-conditioning’ system works by controlled, channelled winds that blow over from a water reservoir within the premises.","copyright":"Amber Fort near Jaipur, Rajasthan (© Luigi Vaccarella/Sime/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Amber+Fort&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200131_1830%22","date":"20200131","image":{"name":"OHR.AmberFort_EN-IN1877330160.jpg","hd":"/images/578814832850BB9D1A2195BE6CE33611B5D1122B96106A8F97EA1DEDF072DD7E.jpg","tmb":"/images/3CBC771C80092ECEC3FF5F7DA6DB0656642D7783392DEB283D03ADD50610CBE0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmberFort_EN-IN1877330160_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmberFort_EN-IN1877330160_tmb.jpg"}}
