The age-old western tradition of hiding (and finding) Easter eggs is yet to catch on in India, but Easter eggs are not new to India. Bakeries all over the country have traditionally produced Easter eggs out of various edible substances like sugar, chocolate, or hollow eggs filled with sweets, while children love to colour their own Easter eggs as playthings (just make sure they’re hard boiled!).
