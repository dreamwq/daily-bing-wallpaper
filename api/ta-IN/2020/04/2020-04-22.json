{"title":"Duck, duck. duck, duck, duck...","caption":"Duck, duck. duck, duck, duck...","desc":"When king eider duck males line up in a dandy display like this, it's likely because they're courting a hen (or what birders call a 'queen eider'). These colourful drakes aren't your regular birds. They're sea ducks, a group that includes several large duck species that feed off the coast in saltwater. As you can see, male king eiders have striking multicoloured plumage and yellow-knobbed beaks that resemble crowns. They, and the less-ornate brown females, make their home in the frigid waters along the Arctic coasts of northern Europe, North America, and Asia.","copyright":"Male king eider ducks swimming in Troms og Finnmark, Norway (Â© Pal Hermansen/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=king+eider+duck&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200422_1830%22","date":"20200422","image":{"name":"OHR.KingEider_EN-IN7669226882.jpg","hd":"/images/E6773D56FDFCC3A40C32B832E3BB71BB1B5234A55CF8C2A4F022AB3C48B98866.jpg","tmb":"/images/D3C9E3837D69857C91690B59F9CCEA8AD7D9E0B1C583E92A15D538A3E9BA6A31.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KingEider_EN-IN7669226882_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KingEider_EN-IN7669226882_tmb.jpg"}}
