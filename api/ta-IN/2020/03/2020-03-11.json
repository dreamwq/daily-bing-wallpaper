{"title":"Fiesta at Siesta","caption":"Fiesta at Siesta","desc":"Here we are in mid-March already, the time of year when beaches are getting crowded again, as winter ends - like this one on Florida's Siesta Key (southern United States). Located in Sarasota County off Florida's western shore, the island beach is a fixture on lists of America's top beaches, a standout even in a state where soft, welcoming sands compose over half the 2,000-kilometre coastline. One of the outstanding features of Siesta key is, the beach’s sand is made up 99% of quartz (unlike most other beaches that are made up of pulverised coral).","copyright":"Aerial view of Siesta Beach, Siesta Key, Florida, USA (© Julie Palermo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=siesta+key+beach&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200311_1830%22","date":"20200311","image":{"name":"OHR.SiestaKey_EN-IN7740147524.jpg","hd":"/images/3C605CDBF54C56DC97ADA14A8E4EBDEE0E28B0145881F2C28FBBF66C071FBC7C.jpg","tmb":"/images/646FA99143B590770ED37DEB065845B0251C6DE5166E3A5B397808D690F0C3EB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SiestaKey_EN-IN7740147524_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SiestaKey_EN-IN7740147524_tmb.jpg"}}
