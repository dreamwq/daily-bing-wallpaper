Shivaji was known for his administrative excellence and his organised civil rule having well-structured administration. During his reign in the latter sixteen hundreds, Shivaji had both alliances and disputes with Moghul rulers. Capturing many forts and building many others, he is also remembered for his impressive naval fleet, the first of its kind in the Maratha empire. The first use of the term ‘Chhatrapati’ (emperor) with reference to Shivaji, was in 1674 at Rajgad, the capital of his empire, where his fort still stands testimony to his success.","copyright":"Statue of Shivaji in Solapur, Maharashtra (© Dinodia Photo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=chatrapathi+shivaji&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200218_1830%22","date":"20200218","image":{"name":"OHR.ShivajiHorse_EN-IN8237639530.jpg","hd":"/images/9E254F2B837EE945D5C3BDA8D67B95AC77F2ECC4713F485B9EEC664C14D4675C.jpg","tmb":"/images/DB9D19D8C6A3EED89C53753035832EA5A69116DAF0AB8AA43F3ED5FFC6D116FC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShivajiHorse_EN-IN8237639530_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShivajiHorse_EN-IN8237639530_tmb.jpg"}}
