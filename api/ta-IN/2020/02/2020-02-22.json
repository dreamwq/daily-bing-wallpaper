{"title":"An icy extravaganza","caption":"An icy extravaganza","desc":"We’re just outside of Brainerd, Minnesota (northern United States), for the Ice Fishing Extravaganza on Gull Lake. Each year from late January on, more than 10,000 people will come out to catch as many fish as they can—mostly walleye and northern pike, but all fish species are eligible. The contest is organised and run by volunteers exclusively, and 100 percent of the proceeds—around $150,000—goes to local charities.","copyright":"People ice fishing on Gull Lake in Brainerd, Minnesota, USA (© Robert Benson/Cavan)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=ice+fishing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200222_1830%22","date":"20200222","image":{"name":"OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-IN1775867214.jpg","hd":"/images/421EF57FBC9ADCD8419F7306213EAE5C7B9266CD437CAE9CE9A8F3FA7F34DA78.jpg","tmb":"/images/B42A9ACFB3E53E9EAE72357ED61D65374DFA6BA96DC44AD5BEE74E790FE559A2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-IN1775867214_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-IN1775867214_tmb.jpg"}}
