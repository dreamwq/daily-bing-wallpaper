{"title":"Two rocks and a heart spot","caption":"Two rocks and a heart spot","desc":"If you really want to earn someone's affections, fly them to Corsica, rent a car, and take a drive on the only road that cuts through the red volcanic rocks of Calanques de Piana. Some call the naturally occurring rock formation in today’s Valentine's Day photo ‘the two lovers,’ while others call it ‘the heart of Corsica.’ (Spot the heart?) Like most affairs of the heart, the path to this geological Valentine is circuitous—it's a winding road, sometimes too narrow to share with oncoming vehicles (the occasional pullovers help). Our vantage point may be a good spot for you to pull over, especially if it’s sunset, to see the rocks aglow as the sun creeps west toward the horizon.","copyright":"A heart-shaped hole in the rock formation of Calanques de Piana in Corsica, France (© joningall/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=calanques+de+piana+corsica&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200213_1830%22","date":"20200213","image":{"name":"OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-IN7291384976.jpg","hd":"/images/5E144AE43ED3A9646BA69E08C6EDC6EF702A79CA3C35034A4E3990B1F03809F4.jpg","tmb":"/images/9C7678AC5F43F9019A1A4671F0E7520F267A1E7F70015804A68253D857D8A4A3.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-IN7291384976_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorsicaHeart_EN-IN7291384976_tmb.jpg"}}
