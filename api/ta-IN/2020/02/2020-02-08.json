{"title":"Hollywood's big night","caption":"Hollywood's big night","desc":"It's Oscars night in Tinseltown, USA, and we're offering you a moment's escape from the paparazzi to gaze over the glittering megalopolis of Los Angeles, California—and to get an unfamiliar view of a familiar landmark. The Hollywood Sign originally read 'Hollywoodland' when it was erected in 1923 and festooned with light bulbs to advertise a real estate development. But within a few years, as the silent-film era gave way to 'talkies,' the sign evolved into a popular tourist attraction. Falling into disrepair in ensuing decades—at the peak of its decay, the sign was missing its third 'O' altogether—the original was demolished and a sturdier version built in 1978.","copyright":"The Hollywood sign overlooking Los Angeles, California (© Sean Pavone/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=hollywood+sign&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200208_1830%22","date":"20200208","image":{"name":"OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-IN2211731012.jpg","hd":"/images/276D3FE6B9EE92A3A9A2B7D701A118B41D4E4D4C539310B204D46D1C36F2952A.jpg","tmb":"/images/6C6C1C74337F0C89738B74D89E2A5E42419217DE1B2D0F427BF9B2A62E195DD7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-IN2211731012_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-IN2211731012_tmb.jpg"}}
