{"title":"Welcome to California, USA","caption":"Welcome to California, USA","desc":"These are the peaks of Mount Diablo, part of the Diablo mountain range in the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the Sierra Nevada mountains, 260 kilometres away from here. In fact, this is one of the best viewsheds in the Bay Area, which is a feat, since the peaks are comparatively low for the region. While Mount Diablo may tempt you to take in the scenery or hike in the surrounding state park, the area offers compelling stories from American history as well.","copyright":"Mount Diablo State Park, California, USA (Â© Yuval Helfman/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mount+diablo+state+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191103_1830%22","date":"20191103","image":{"name":"OHR.MtDiablo_EN-IN3497522025.jpg","hd":"/images/B74995C7408D96F499F4D39BF9D66CA96F3E2F5F82526CA00863DDD83D7CC34C.jpg","tmb":"/images/81359D3F1723D3AB335B06BD5B9E3271E7992E3ACE6EE14B3A85EAFFCF979687.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtDiablo_EN-IN3497522025_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtDiablo_EN-IN3497522025_tmb.jpg"}}
