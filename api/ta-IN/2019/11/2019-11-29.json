However, handicrafts markets and bazaars will always find a place for those looking for something unique. Of course, the concept of patronising local merchants is nothing new. Here in Marrakesh, Morocco, souks (markets) like this one in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers, and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing, and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different specialties and takes on traditional Moroccan food.","copyright":"Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh (Â© Pavliha/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jemaa+el-Fnaa+Square&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191129_1830%22","date":"20191129","image":{"name":"OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-IN9420511751.jpg","hd":"/images/E3938A744D9073066AA45D87569B2F22238054208346E8BA65057AB6FBB7ECCB.jpg","tmb":"/images/78284074A094818475C31050B435A293384FC13D6A0BA88A17E2AC9C88C70C86.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-IN9420511751_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-IN9420511751_tmb.jpg"}}
