{"title":"It’s Wild Koala Day!","caption":"It’s Wild Koala Day!","desc":"Today, on Wild Koala Day, we celebrate one of the most quintessentially Australian animals. Beloved not just by locals, but countless around the globe, the marsupial spends many a day napping and snacking on eucalyptus leaves. Started by a group of non-profit Koala-centric charities, Wild Koala Day is designed not only to celebrate the koala, but to also help raise awareness for the protection of their habitats.","copyright":"An Australian koala perched in a gum tree overlooking the scenery (© juuce/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=wild+koala+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200502_1400%22","date":"20200502","image":{"name":"OHR.PerchedKoala_EN-AU7288262876.jpg","hd":"/images/2BBB7F3AF8B0808CACFFA0F6D41FCAF9741DA5F5C1B0FCD43591FADCF4AB0CC8.jpg","tmb":"/images/A742A8D6FE9FDB223BF5D3957169A372594827C7DA54C28D217D54DC6851CD7A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PerchedKoala_EN-AU7288262876_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PerchedKoala_EN-AU7288262876_tmb.jpg"}}
