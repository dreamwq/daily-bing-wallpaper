The over 350 known species of turtles alive today are found on every continent, except Antarctica. But despite their wide distribution, most turtles are endangered due to loss of habitat, illegal wildlife trade, hunting, and fishing. World Turtle Day aims to change that by raising awareness about their plight and encouraging conservation efforts. So today, we invite you to stick your neck out for turtles.","copyright":"A male yellow-bellied slider (Â© Marko Markovic Photography/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=turtles&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200522_1400%22","date":"20200522","image":{"name":"OHR.SunSalutation_EN-AU0361816877.jpg","hd":"/images/9C8E555075184269656F7F7EB41F62C7978808109BCD97EE9544BC28C8B0F7F3.jpg","tmb":"/images/B3E2030A91DCF418C118E43AC5C935A9EA7AD09209978D4EFCDD2F0BE5275CB8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunSalutation_EN-AU0361816877_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunSalutation_EN-AU0361816877_tmb.jpg"}}
