No matter the season, there are flowerbeds aplenty, ornamental lakes and magnificent fountains like the one you see today. The Gardens even host plantings in honour of the Dalai Lama. Then there is the Royal Exhibition Building – the oldest surviving building from the Great Exhibition.","copyright":"Carlton Gardens fountain and autumn trees catching the sunlight in front of the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne (© CBCK-Christine/iStock/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=carlton+gardens+melbourne&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200510_1400%22","date":"20200510","image":{"name":"OHR.CarltonGardens_EN-AU8135847184.jpg","hd":"/images/986005B79CEEF4311DC0FCC3267D0F8634BA6948EA3BA3BA7AF8AD21E45B5440.jpg","tmb":"/images/65EAA9FD3BE607522511EE52257827C9BB0108CF316256C3C3D8DF773117F71E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarltonGardens_EN-AU8135847184_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarltonGardens_EN-AU8135847184_tmb.jpg"}}
