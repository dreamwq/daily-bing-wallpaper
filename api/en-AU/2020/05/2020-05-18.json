{"title":"Loud waters","caption":"Loud waters","desc":"Roaring Fork may seem like a misnomer for this mountain stream in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During dry spells, it's an idyllic mountain stream in the US state of Tennessee. But Roaring Fork descends 762 metres over just three kilometres - a steep drop down Mount Le Conte. When heavy rains swell the stream, Roaring Fork transforms into a whitewater rush, with the sound of the surging water echoing off the sandstone walls of the mountain.","copyright":"Roaring Fork in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (Â© Paul Hassell/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=roaring+fork+great+smoky+mountains&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200518_1400%22","date":"20200518","image":{"name":"OHR.RoaringFork_EN-AU1982707691.jpg","hd":"/images/9E0918EBEDE444A9533C10ED57CCA18EE916B4AEF15A2C216365A7E75EACA914.jpg","tmb":"/images/0BC6D52B53ECEF9BB97D01360E7700B258DD97098CD74BEE1E654994567B6D4F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RoaringFork_EN-AU1982707691_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RoaringFork_EN-AU1982707691_tmb.jpg"}}
