{"title":"It's World Bee Day","caption":"It's World Bee Day","desc":"Today we've buzzed to Provence, France, to enjoy this scenic view brought to you by bees. These hard-working insects are key pollinators of flowers, like the nectar-rich lavender seen growing here. Bees are also critical for the pollination of fruits and vegetables - about a third of the food we eat is a result of honeybee pollination. In the US, honeybees, whether tended by beekeepers or living in the wild, pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops every year. That's a lot of gold - and doesn't even include their delicious honey. So today, on World Bee Day, we invite you to stop and smell the flowers and give a nod to the bees that help colour our world.","copyright":"Fields of lavender and sunflowers with beehives in Provence, France (Â© leoks/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Beekeeping&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200519_1400%22","date":"20200519","image":{"name":"OHR.LavenderBee_EN-AU2213767926.jpg","hd":"/images/11FF0C091B624350A11DB6DE51995F2D4E9D9C704D1A4F4FC2742B668E772CDD.jpg","tmb":"/images/597A7B7354B16860F6698F0AD880C8236E736CF7765212D503F0045A721ED76A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-AU2213767926_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LavenderBee_EN-AU2213767926_tmb.jpg"}}
