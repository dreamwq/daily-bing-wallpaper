{"title":"A tree amid the Tetons","caption":"A tree amid the Tetons","desc":"This limber pine standing alone in the sage brush flats of America’s Grand Teton National Park has a name - Old Patriarch. Commonly found in the Rocky Mountains, limber pines are known to stand the test of time - literally. Some people estimate Old Patriarch to be more than a thousand years old. The 'Cathedral Group' of the Teton Mountains forms a breathtaking backdrop, bursting up from the valley floor below and stretching dramatically to the soaring peaks. The park spreads out below the spires for 125,452 hectares, creating a home for extraordinary wildlife, pristine lakes, and alpine terrain. Sounds like the Old Patriarch has found quite a home for himself.","copyright":"The Old Patriarch Tree of Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming (© George Sanker/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=grand+teton+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200515_1400%22","date":"20200515","image":{"name":"OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-AU4661318212.jpg","hd":"/images/A85745A7F394F27171A6BB63166993DA1D9C3118F372F443C16F4CDC159A6CE5.jpg","tmb":"/images/C4969E0159BB220417B134571A15E8B27C81E4E26E7EC71D5551239CFB9BD1BC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-AU4661318212_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-AU4661318212_tmb.jpg"}}
