{"title":"It's Star Wars Day","caption":"It's Star Wars Day","desc":"Does this area look familiar? If you're a 'Star Wars' fan you might recognise it as the planet of Crait, featured in 'The Last Jedi'. In reality it's Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, found in southwest Bolivia. This otherworldly landscape is near the crest of the Andes, nearly 3,600 metres above sea level. It was formed by the transformations of prehistoric lakes which dried up in this area, leaving behind a salt crust around a metre deep. After a rare rainfall, a thin layer of perfectly still water will transform the salt flat into a giant mirror 128 kilometres across.","copyright":"Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia (Â© Ignacio Palacios/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=star+wars+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200503_1400%22","date":"20200503","image":{"name":"OHR.LastJedi_EN-AU4143758586.jpg","hd":"/images/CDA437C9B8DDDDFEED97F7235A8A8D4D22CA5D5147BCF3EBBCE626367B88654E.jpg","tmb":"/images/189CC59A9AD94D2FB406E0437E5D89AB3528C664989912CC5C37FF1B23100F88.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-AU4143758586_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-AU4143758586_tmb.jpg"}}
