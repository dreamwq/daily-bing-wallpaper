{"title":"Brotherly cubs","caption":"Brotherly cubs","desc":"They’re very cute but we’re betting these two Kermode bear siblings are a handful (hang in there, mama bear!). Kermode bears are a subspecies of the American black bear, although they're obviously not always black. They have a recessive gene which sometimes results in cream or white fur. While most Kermode bears are black, scientists estimate that between 10 and 20 per cent of the population have ivory coats. Known as ‘spirit bears’, they are special to indigenous people of the British Columbia coastal regions in Canada where they live. Today is Siblings Day in the US, which celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters.","copyright":"A Kermode bear cub huddling with its sibling in Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, British Columbia (© Ian McAllister/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=kermode+bear&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200409_1400%22","date":"20200409","image":{"name":"OHR.SpiritSiblings_EN-AU8421481154.jpg","hd":"/images/5484AD82140DA86227F9D6CFAD2389A65FC3C5CEDC9D2EEB2BD19BD4451DFF7B.jpg","tmb":"/images/DBDB21B7168DEE4B6E2FE896D88F1DD7C1A5A18B47FA2BFF1FD4C2EAE32E38E7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpiritSiblings_EN-AU8421481154_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpiritSiblings_EN-AU8421481154_tmb.jpg"}}
