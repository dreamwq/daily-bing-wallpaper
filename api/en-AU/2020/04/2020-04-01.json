{"title":"Treading the boards","caption":"Treading the boards","desc":"We’re at the Ponce de León Inlet Light, a lighthouse in the US state of Florida, for Pascua Florida Day, marking the anniversary of the Spanish explorer's arrival here in 1513. Believing it to be an island, Ponce de León claimed the land for Spain and named it 'La Florida' because of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called 'Pascua Florida' (Festival of Flowers). According to legend, Ponce de León arrived here in search of the Fountain of Youth, a mythical water source said to restore the youth of those who drink or bathe in its waters. While that mission was unsuccessful, his name lives on in history and on this lighthouse and the inlet where it shines.","copyright":"Looking inland from Ponce de León Inlet toward the lighthouse, Florida (© Jason Sponseller/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=ponce+de+leon+inlet+light&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200401_1300%22","date":"20200401","image":{"name":"OHR.PascuaFlorida_EN-AU5667922431.jpg","hd":"/images/3529826415CED7296C4562E8E6AA8B12C8DBA0205DC7A6385B26416489A9F673.jpg","tmb":"/images/AAC42E599CAFA1D74B2ED055F745C78601B9635B8D49A5FDE045EBEAC991C2DD.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PascuaFlorida_EN-AU5667922431_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PascuaFlorida_EN-AU5667922431_tmb.jpg"}}
