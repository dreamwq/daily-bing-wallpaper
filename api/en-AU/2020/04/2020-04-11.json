{"title":"Easter Egg-stravaganza","caption":"Easter Egg-stravaganza","desc":"These egg-shaped decorations hanging in Alexanderplatz, a public square in Germany’s capital city Berlin, are just one example of an Easter tradition that goes back centuries. While Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar, some of its symbols are of pagan origin and eggs have long been associated with new life and spring. Chocolate eggs were not really introduced until the 19th century, but decorating eggs is a tradition that goes back long before. England’s King Edward I reportedly bought 450 eggs to be decorated and distributed to his household as far back as 1290.","copyright":"Easter decorations at Alexanderplatz, Berlin (© plainpicture/Christian Reister)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Easter+Sunday&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200411_1400%22","date":"20200411","image":{"name":"OHR.EastereggsBerlin_EN-AU9551768580.jpg","hd":"/images/1D0680D6714FA2B22ADA2BC0C2E2D982BE89431D27015A8CF71131D2EA7BA3EA.jpg","tmb":"/images/963EC000832A10EB58FAC0426960F86F86E53E5E5B9FC08E204956677EC15BB6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EastereggsBerlin_EN-AU9551768580_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EastereggsBerlin_EN-AU9551768580_tmb.jpg"}}
