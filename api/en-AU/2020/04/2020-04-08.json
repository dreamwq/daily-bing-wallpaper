To honour the mythical horned beast, we bring you the next best thing: a pod of narwhals brandishing their tusks in the Arctic Ocean. Narwhals develop only two teeth, but - in males especially - the left canine can grow into a three-metre-long spiral tusk. As the tusk juts out of the top of their head, it's given the whale the nickname, 'unicorn of the sea'.","copyright":"A pod of narwhals near Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada (© Eric Baccega/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=narwhal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200408_1400%22","date":"20200408","image":{"name":"OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-AU6753820603.jpg","hd":"/images/719B77DCC9520A66079C24F334DC51D0F641539C8A548A76AB12D5539D778366.jpg","tmb":"/images/0DEA8C2C54F26D35D094FE43AB475DB24AA98F587E3C727B5347F45A1F2392DA.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-AU6753820603_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-AU6753820603_tmb.jpg"}}
