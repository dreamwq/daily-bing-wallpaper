{"title":"Roman treasure","caption":"The largest gold mine of the Roman empire","desc":"This landscape might look natural, but you may be surprised to learn that’s not entirely the case. Welcome to Las Médulas Cultural Park, in León, Spain - an ancient Roman gold mining site which was once the Empire’s largest open-air mine. Romans started exploiting the site during the first century and continued doing so for over 150 years. By removing more than 500 million cubic metres of earth, the landscape was therefore transformed forever.","copyright":"Ancient Roman gold mining site of Las Médulas, León, Spain (© DEEPOL by plainpicture/David Santiago Garcia)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=las+m%c3%a9dulas+le%c3%b3n+&FORM=Hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200410_1400%22","date":"20200410","image":{"name":"OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-AU4545953159.jpg","hd":"/images/6458EB01A2501B772897745DB1AB19EEBA4359A2B3DB4FF9B1997269DF5DD0F8.jpg","tmb":"/images/3B159073104FD7D522AC55AA5D89AD83B89CDBDFF33F4CC7E11BDD66303BCDDD.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-AU4545953159_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasMedulasMine_EN-AU4545953159_tmb.jpg"}}
