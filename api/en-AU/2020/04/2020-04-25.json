{"title":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","caption":"Rockin' with the rockhoppers","desc":"Today we're featuring a jaunty group of southern rockhopper penguins on a Falkland Islands beach. Most penguins slide over the ice on their bellies, but these small penguins opt for more aerobic locomotion - they hop. Of all penguin species, rockhoppers are among the most numerous. But pollution, overfishing, and climate change have taken a toll: their population has declined by about 30 per cent over the last 30 years. Today, there's an estimated 1.5 million breeding pairs of rockhoppers. About a million of those are southern rockhopper couples, like these, with the northern and eastern subspecies filling out the rest of numbers.","copyright":"Southern rockhopper penguins on the Falkland Islands (Â© Heike Odermatt/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=rockhopper+penguin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200425_1400%22","date":"20200425","image":{"name":"OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-AU5891260610.jpg","hd":"/images/EA71B2138529542A13FD7C279B46A6E737AAE1B28156FFB5477A085B45B587D1.jpg","tmb":"/images/AECA67F49B4F0F4450428C37B4002A248C0001F46725E38CB195CDB7B3D4DEB9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-AU5891260610_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FalklandRockhoppers_EN-AU5891260610_tmb.jpg"}}
