He's practicing a relatively young sport known as speed riding - similar to paragliding but with more emphasis on high velocity than altitude. Skiers with parachute-like 'wings' launch downslope at high speed, navigating runs partly on skis and partly in the air.","copyright":"Backcountry adventurer Alex Peterson speed riding on the south side of Mount Hood, Oregon (Â© Richard Hallman/DEEPOL by plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=skiing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200118_1300%22","date":"20200118","image":{"name":"OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-AU4701306692.jpg","hd":"/images/271B72E8E1EB790B1A87E9B251E911F857E328251AAAD26763D3CA2210683B8A.jpg","tmb":"/images/106D0CCA711B61D05C6451EE3DB4A3E932A6DEE79055A31A70EFA8A44C70A4F2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-AU4701306692_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-AU4701306692_tmb.jpg"}}
