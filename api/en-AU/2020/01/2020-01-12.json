{"title":"Dancing waters of Dubai","caption":"Dancing waters of Dubai","desc":"With the 2009 opening of the Dubai Fountain, featured in today's image, the city of Dubai claims another record to the books - 'world tallest performing fountain’ - located appropriately enough at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest building. Designed by the same company that created the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, everything about the Dubai Fountain is impressive. Over 274 metres long and located in the 12-hectare Burj Lake, the fountain has more than 6,600 lights and 75 colour projectors, which are used to create over 1,000 different 'water expressions' and provide a full spectrum of colour all perfectly choreographed to a carefully crafted musical playlist.","copyright":"The Dubai Fountain in Burj Lake taken from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai (© Eli Asenova/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Dubai+Fountain&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200112_1300%22","date":"20200112","image":{"name":"OHR.DubaiFountain_EN-AU7877583835.jpg","hd":"/images/31403E575501D6FAAE10F62C26102FF7E9417F1E03B50356DBA99C3F64ABC466.jpg","tmb":"/images/C312A49B4CAE0E91091675CAA31D4EA1D7F5011C9478AFF263F30E6FF64EBEF3.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DubaiFountain_EN-AU7877583835_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DubaiFountain_EN-AU7877583835_tmb.jpg"}}
