Remember the name? It's that unpronounceable volcano that made you miss your connecting flight back in 2010. That eruption and the vast ash cloud it belched over the North Atlantic was the biggest disruption to air traffic since World War II. And this relatively small, but volatile island may yet waylay the world again: Eyjafjallajökull is a lightweight among the 32 active volcanic systems dotting the Land of Fire and Ice - its much larger neighbour Katla has been closely monitored since the 2010 incident.","copyright":"Sunlit ridges against volcanic scree on Eyjafjallajökull, a volcano in Iceland (© Erlend Haarberg/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=eyjafjallajokull&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200123_1300%22","date":"20200123","image":{"name":"OHR.SunlitScree_EN-AU6750763237.jpg","hd":"/images/E6A3FC03DA19C05802236BB243866C241D7A1F55DA606586325A5377FE87D7B3.jpg","tmb":"/images/22FE2866712577D508175F67D3729F66B854AB22ED72BC8FE4D39A15D99EE885.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunlitScree_EN-AU6750763237_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunlitScree_EN-AU6750763237_tmb.jpg"}}
