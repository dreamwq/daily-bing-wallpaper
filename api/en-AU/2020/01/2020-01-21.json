The area enjoys frequent and spectacular light shows, thanks to the aurora borealis. The mechanics of northern lights are still not fully understood, but scientists agree that solar winds - big pulses of energy from our sun - pass through the Earth's magnetic fields, especially at the polar regions, resulting in shimmering colours.","copyright":"Northern lights near Whitehorse in Yukon, Canada (Â© Design Pics/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=northern+lights&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200121_1300%22","date":"20200121","image":{"name":"OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-AU6311959726.jpg","hd":"/images/7D8193F937F06C9DEE4AC601775A021D575261E788D485C637C6985ECD0C55EB.jpg","tmb":"/images/5EC4F0F747D8DC78F58D7E6A8B9C72072B91A5CAE8AE02A0B6C0765FE379B395.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-AU6311959726_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-AU6311959726_tmb.jpg"}}
