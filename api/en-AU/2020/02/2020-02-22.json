{"title":"An icy extravaganza","caption":"An icy extravaganza","desc":"We’re just outside of Brainerd, Minnesota, for the Ice Fishing Extravaganza on Gull Lake. Each year in late January, more than 10,000 people will come out to catch as many fish as they can - mostly walleye and northern pike, but all fish species are eligible. The contest is organised and run by volunteers exclusively, and 100 per cent of the proceeds - around AU$220,000 - goes to local charities.","copyright":"People ice fishing on Gull Lake in Brainerd, Minnesota (© Robert Benson/Cavan)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=ice+fishing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200222_1300%22","date":"20200222","image":{"name":"OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-AU8888571097.jpg","hd":"/images/421EF57FBC9ADCD8419F7306213EAE5C7B9266CD437CAE9CE9A8F3FA7F34DA78.jpg","tmb":"/images/CECCA936724FB8309DBAF8E1BE11C6D1773A5966775DE860674E4A145105A0FE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-AU8888571097_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeGullMN_EN-AU8888571097_tmb.jpg"}}
