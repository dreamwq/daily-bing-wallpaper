{"title":"Après-ski in the Dolomites","caption":"Après-ski in the Dolomites","desc":"Today's homepage image features Rifugio Lagazuoi, a ski lodge located at about 2,700 metres above sea level on Italy's Mount Lagazuoi. With an elevation higher than most ski lodges in this area of the Dolomites, it gives visitors opportunities for breathtaking views like this one. The ruggedly beautiful mountain landscapes, pristine natural environments, and distinctive geologic formations all contributed to the Dolomites being recognised as an UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009.","copyright":"Rifugio Lagazuoi above the clouds with Monte Pelmo in the background, Dolomites, Italy (© Nicolo Miana/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=lagazuoi+mountain+italy&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200219_1300%22","date":"20200219","image":{"name":"OHR.CloudsPelmo_EN-AU6736916892.jpg","hd":"/images/1A15B1DACFAEE2CFC6E8CAFBE5EB2BD52FCB863D61352B85B72641F42B2DFEA6.jpg","tmb":"/images/D3A725211DC6A64C9C563D9EFDAF936C62FBD5F0D85E35EF4431B1DF80B23EDB.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CloudsPelmo_EN-AU6736916892_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CloudsPelmo_EN-AU6736916892_tmb.jpg"}}
