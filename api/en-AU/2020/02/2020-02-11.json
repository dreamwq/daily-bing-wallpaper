Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he published in his 1859 book 'On the Origin of Species.' During his travels to the Galápagos Islands years earlier, Darwin observed creatures that were similar from island to island but had slightly different adaptations to better survive in their specific environments. This became a key component of his research.","copyright":"Pinzon Island tortoise hatchling emerging from its egg at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, Galápagos Islands, Ecuador (© Pete Oxford/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gal%c3%a1pagos+tortoise&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200211_1300%22","date":"20200211","image":{"name":"OHR.PinzonIslandTortoise_EN-AU1420828950.jpg","hd":"/images/932B470CDE4DC5E825E0BF3B5D34EE57F587AAFC22E153671DACD463B4BF1BBB.jpg","tmb":"/images/80365303815E9F18D11287819AFA9C881F485492F75EADB91AF6BBD3B9B0BAE1.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinzonIslandTortoise_EN-AU1420828950_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PinzonIslandTortoise_EN-AU1420828950_tmb.jpg"}}
