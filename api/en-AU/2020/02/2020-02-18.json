{"title":"Flocking together in the Antarctic","caption":"Flocking together in the Antarctic","desc":"These birds are a few days late for Valentine's Day, but they look like they're in the mood for love. Wandering albatrosses (also known as snowy albatrosses, white-winged albatrosses, or goonies) live mostly on the open ocean but come on land for mating season. A salt gland on the top of their nasal passages allows them to desalinate and survive drinking only saltwater as they feed on small marine animals. They can float on the sea surface and glide for hours.","copyright":"Wandering albatross pair, South Georgia island (Â© David Tipling Photo Library/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=wandering+albatross&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200218_1300%22","date":"20200218","image":{"name":"OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-AU6502254613.jpg","hd":"/images/CA6345841F40F75E33D196451E00376A9C4D2093970622A64F781D70F934E555.jpg","tmb":"/images/3727CAF29B0601FAD2E3FB297AE0D2A5F50B6DE3D23D79CC22CE0012E26A5D32.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-AU6502254613_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WanderingAlbatross_EN-AU6502254613_tmb.jpg"}}
