{"title":"This park is Superkilen","caption":"This park is Superkilen","desc":"Welcome to Superkilen, an 800-metre-long linear urban park meant to inspire long-time residents, immigrants, and visitors alike to congregate together in Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen's most culturally and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. What was once a public space battling gang activity, graffiti, and vandalism, is now an example of 'extreme public participation'. The residents who live around Superkilen helped design it, including the addition of cultural objects that represent their homelands - more than 60 countries.","copyright":"Aerial view of Superkilen Park in Norrebro district in Copenhagen, Denmark (© Oliver Förstner/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=superkilen+park+copenhagen&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200208_1300%22","date":"20200208","image":{"name":"OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-AU0885052403.jpg","hd":"/images/90CEA2ECF50EC81DBE626239C8EC7B7F9A0F4FBE055EE77A0D6FA400B4FD7308.jpg","tmb":"/images/EAE09E24479EFB14C407239AD1427603432A6E1B84322ED00DD3296A5EF61E0F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-AU0885052403_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-AU0885052403_tmb.jpg"}}
