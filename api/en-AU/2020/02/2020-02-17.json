{"title":"Too awesome to be a planet","caption":"Too awesome to be a planet","desc":"Pluto was first spotted on this day in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Because it’s so far away - about 40 times as far from the Sun as Earth is - scientists knew relatively little about Pluto until the New Horizons spacecraft reached it in 2015. In a flyby study, the craft spent more than five months gathering detailed information about Pluto and its moons. What did they find out? There’s a heart-shaped glacier, blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows - but the snow is red.","copyright":"Pluto's crescent imaged by NASA's New Horizons interplanetary space probe (© NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI/Science Photo Library)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pluto+planet&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200217_1300%22","date":"20200217","image":{"name":"OHR.PlutoCrescent_EN-AU6276897229.jpg","hd":"/images/7DE159841A1D6F4AF3E289123BC58A3B17CDABC1D48947B11AB37065EBEBA948.jpg","tmb":"/images/6155C64BDAD9E6220B7A0BFDA4756630CE0DA43486270F070F3E656219B6F3D8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlutoCrescent_EN-AU6276897229_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlutoCrescent_EN-AU6276897229_tmb.jpg"}}
