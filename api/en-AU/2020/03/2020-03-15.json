It's Shakespeare Week in schools across the pond, so we're field-tripping to the British Library for a peek at the only surviving specimen of what's thought to be playwright William Shakespeare's handwriting (if you don't count legal documents). The scratchy cursive is inked within the script of Anthony Munday's 'Sir Thomas More', a then-controversial play about a king-defying statesman. In 1603, the censorious royal Office of the Revels brought in Shakespeare among a team of writers to retool the script. But if Shakespeare's task was to tone things down, he may have had other ideas: his three-page addition includes an impassioned speech by the title character to a mob that's rioting over immigration policy.","copyright":"Shakespeare's handwriting from the play 'Sir Thomas More', British Library, London (© British Library/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=william+shakespeare&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200315_1300%22","date":"20200315","image":{"name":"OHR.SirThomasMore_EN-AU4141871892.jpg","hd":"/images/789C8C3D4279D064FDE9200899A433F2CB47E1F327D25D62EB6CDF4AD087CB77.jpg","tmb":"/images/61301850F8AE649248FF97A33489675C7A54BAECC5724F0F5E33800AFC8466B6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SirThomasMore_EN-AU4141871892_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SirThomasMore_EN-AU4141871892_tmb.jpg"}}
