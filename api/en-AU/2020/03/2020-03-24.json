Tolkien's original manuscripts and drawings. While Tolkien never worked in the Radcliffe Camera (Latin for 'room'), he both studied here at Oxford (graduating in 1915 with first-class honours in English language) and taught here as a professor of Anglo-Saxon and later as a professor of English language and literature.","copyright":"The Radcliffe Camera, Oxford, England for Tolkien Reading Day (Â© Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=tolkien+reading+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200324_1300%22","date":"20200324","image":{"name":"OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-AU5402058956.jpg","hd":"/images/70DDDBEC883677150C9D0C5AC368BDD1F9C4BCFA7092F0073FBE2E7A6B0F1774.jpg","tmb":"/images/647727E5E06C0C79109E11BF989F723CC31FDCCFE134E5AFC3176CDA99E1BEC2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-AU5402058956_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-AU5402058956_tmb.jpg"}}
