{"title":"Celebrating World Water Day","caption":"Celebrating World Water Day","desc":"The stepwell that these women are climbing is an apt image to mark World Water Day. Stepwells originated in western India over a thousand years ago as way for locals in that arid climate to easily and reliably access fresh water - even during the driest months. The Panna Meena Ka Kund stepwell in Jaipur is a classic example of the beautiful, regular, geometric architecture used to produce these useful public works. Most stepwells also feature shaded side chambers where locals (primarily women) can gather to escape the heat of the day.","copyright":"Local women climbing a stepwell near Amber Fort in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India (Â© Shanna Baker/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=world+water+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200321_1300%22","date":"20200321","image":{"name":"OHR.StepWell_EN-AU4969620144.jpg","hd":"/images/FF4908213654F119E443CAC579C222D0F701544342DE9259E16199965187F0A2.jpg","tmb":"/images/23C0D62687A18C00AD63CBE44D66DF43A0F3CCE67B63D638F9B4F6C9BD125213.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-AU4969620144_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-AU4969620144_tmb.jpg"}}
