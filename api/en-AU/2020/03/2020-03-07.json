{"title":"Joan charges Riverside Park","caption":"Joan charges Riverside Park","desc":"Sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington was unusual for her era - a successful female artist. In 1910, she first exhibited a version of her Joan of Arc statue at the Salon in Paris, a prestigious art exhibition dating from the 1600s. But she only earned honourable mention because the exhibition’s judges didn’t think a woman working alone could create a sculpture of that magnitude. Paris’ loss is Manhattan’s gain, as the American city soon commissioned a new Saint Joan for display at Riverside Park. It’s stories like this that we enjoy sharing on International Women’s Day.","copyright":"The Joan of Arc Monument at Riverside Park in Manhattan (© Chase Guttman/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Joan+of+Arc+Memorial+Riverside+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200307_1300%22","date":"20200307","image":{"name":"OHR.JoanNYC_EN-AU0823139646.jpg","hd":"/images/5B875310F41D7D99C35A00BE8BBB027D2C6839E36601903AC246AE05C26B9535.jpg","tmb":"/images/83070FF7DB1627E631163A39ECBC73E72FBDB7B25013B5A274793339B69A40F8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JoanNYC_EN-AU0823139646_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JoanNYC_EN-AU0823139646_tmb.jpg"}}
