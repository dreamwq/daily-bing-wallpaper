{"title":"Sunburst at Angkor","caption":"Sunburst at Angkor","desc":"Angkor Wat is the most famous Buddhist temple in Angkor - which is saying a lot, since Angkor Archaeological Park is essentially a 398-square-kilometre collection of historic temples and related holy sites just outside the city of Siem Reap, Cambodia. If you happen to be visiting Angkor Wat during their spring equinox, get there in time for sunrise. On the equinox, the sun aligns with the top of the main tower at Angkor Wat before climbing farther into the sky to usher in longer days and shorter nights. Of course, if this photo is any indication, every sunrise at Angkor Wat is spectacular.","copyright":"Sunrise at Angkor Wat in Cambodia (Â© Sergio Diaz/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Angkor+Wat&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200318_1300%22","date":"20200318","image":{"name":"OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-AU4614209924.jpg","hd":"/images/8FB6528FE8FC8169BC70351765D2D885D500DDE07CFE2C4ED0C7F3FBFA63F43E.jpg","tmb":"/images/3DFE5EC7A834D31ED704CE5576EB3CD2951B2C984B3B77AA32B33B122E006B78.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-AU4614209924_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-AU4614209924_tmb.jpg"}}
