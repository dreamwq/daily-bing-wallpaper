{"title":"The desert blooms","caption":"The desert blooms","desc":"It’s getting to be wildflower season in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. That means it won’t be long before we see blooms from the big daddy of the cactus world - the saguaro. Our homepage pic shows just a glimpse of this amazing succulent. The saguaro is the largest cactus in the United States, capable of growing upwards of 15 metres tall and weighing several tonnes (that’s when it’s fully hydrated). It can live more than 100 years and will grow arms as it ages, creating that classic cactus profile that’s associated with the desert and Old West.","copyright":"Saguaro cactus flowers, Coronado National Forest, Arizona (© Jack Dykinga/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Saguaro+cactus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200304_1300%22","date":"20200304","image":{"name":"OHR.CarnegieaGigantea_EN-AU0499821608.jpg","hd":"/images/58A08FBE6A624C328541E872D720FF02257359FFDE2B9C495DA63FEA5F3156E9.jpg","tmb":"/images/165EADCF5364714B8A14318EA410227E370E176AB6CF4A06DAEF97AAFEF34701.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarnegieaGigantea_EN-AU0499821608_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarnegieaGigantea_EN-AU0499821608_tmb.jpg"}}
