{"title":"Jerte Valley in bloom","caption":"Jerte Valley in bloom","desc":"As winter turns to spring in the Jerte Valley, all eyes are on the cherry blossoms. This tiny region in the province of Cáceres, Spain, has the perfect microclimate for cherry trees, and there are more than 1.5 million of them here in just 60 square kilometres. The cherry blossoms last just two weeks before the petals rain down, covering the entire valley. About 40 days later, the first cherries are ready to be picked. Locals make wine, beer and various foods with them. Cherries are also used for spa and beauty treatments, since they have antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to vitamins and ellagic acid.","copyright":"Blooming cherry trees in Jerte Valley, province of Cáceres, Spain (© Westend61/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=jerte+valley+spain&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200312_1300%22","date":"20200312","image":{"name":"OHR.JerteCherries_EN-AU8434323066.jpg","hd":"/images/C632483989DEEB2325EC235EE6DAEB7AAFDEBAB8862C496EFF779EB358EA5A75.jpg","tmb":"/images/6C7ACAA702CA5F6CC811DA5090A1F56BFA912B82AF1DF89BA5B140BEC82B9EEC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JerteCherries_EN-AU8434323066_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JerteCherries_EN-AU8434323066_tmb.jpg"}}
