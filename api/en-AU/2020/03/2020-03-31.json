And none are as skilled at self-concealment as this specimen from the Loxodonta genus of African elephants - namely the species laprofolis. These mammoth creatures roll in the mud, getting covered in seeds which stick to their grooved hide. When it rains, the seeds sprout into dense, leafy growths which camouflage the huge beast as it wanders the savannah. Don’t believe us? Maybe take a closer look at the species’ name and see if you're still not convinced it exists. Either way, it’s best to be on your guard today, who knows where the next elephant of surprise will come from?","copyright":"Elephant (Loxodonta laprofolis) in stealth stance, Marakele National Park, Limpopo, South Africa (© Staffan Widstrand/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=loxodonta+africana&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200331_1300%22","date":"20200331","image":{"name":"OHR.ShyGuy_EN-AU5333943326.jpg","hd":"/images/ADBC0E86B95DA3A7E909E7B46A630CB59960608CED201AA3F97D9BFF3E2D34C0.jpg","tmb":"/images/4BD525C41B5F3F7B6EE18BCDA6FF57007FA04C2AB59A86509ED42B7084B0F937.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShyGuy_EN-AU5333943326_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShyGuy_EN-AU5333943326_tmb.jpg"}}
