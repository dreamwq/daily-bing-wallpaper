{"title":"The devil you know","caption":"The devil you know","desc":"Don’t let their appearance fool you – Thorny Devils are actually less prickly than you might think. In fact, the endemic creature’s spiky exterior (each of which is said to be similar in size to a rose thorn) actually helps them absorb water in their arid habitat. This can be obtained via dew that condenses on their body overnight or by brushing up against dew-heavy grass. This water then finds its way into the various grooves around the Thorny Devil’s body, and makes its way to the mouth via capillary action.","copyright":"Thorny Devil (Moloch horridus) in Watarrka National Park, Northern Territory (© Yva Momatiuk and John Eastcott/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=thorny+devil&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200308_1300%22","date":"20200308","image":{"name":"OHR.ThornyDevil_EN-AU0656994974.jpg","hd":"/images/3F431D4284629D1A69884B855FA442FF57879DE27CF01C04F1FB6E9A778C6D91.jpg","tmb":"/images/8F54142E24D02D394E14594F18DF0221B19FD0E5EA42E553BCA8ABD0CBE374B0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThornyDevil_EN-AU0656994974_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThornyDevil_EN-AU0656994974_tmb.jpg"}}
