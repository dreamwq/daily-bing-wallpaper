At first glance, visitors likely see a massive grove of quaking aspen trees, their leaves dancing in the wind. But the Pando is not many trees; instead, it's a single organism. Like many aspen groves, each of the 40,000 trees in the Pando are genetically identical stems that sprout from the same root system.","copyright":"The Pando quaking aspen in Fishlake National Forest, Utah (Â© Don Paulson/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pando+tree&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190914_1400%22","date":"20190914","image":{"name":"OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263.jpg","hd":"/images/3710FD85D65CBDB71A0E7113220892CBB34D5683B61B0A98B0E6B1E4AD1FC44A.jpg","tmb":"/images/0C1896CBBB956D41AE11D69C919692958D3BE184A3D93F00CB4086814181F6B7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263_tmb.jpg"}}
