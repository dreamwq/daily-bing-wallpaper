{"title":"A burst of flavours","caption":"A burst of flavours","desc":"Here’s some handy gardening advice: blueberry plants make for a good investment, as they have a lifespan of at least forty years. In Canada, where today’s homepage image was taken, this time of the year is ideal for planting blueberry bushes so they can yield sweet and tangy berries by the time the summer rolls in. That said, planting the bushes throughout the year can also be beneficial as the berries ripen year-long, churning a variety of flavours ranging from sweet to spicy. The plant thrives best in moist, acidic soil with a balance of sun and shade. If all this talk has made you crave blueberries right now, we don’t blame you.","copyright":"Frost on blueberry plants, New Brunswick, Canada (© Freeman Patterson/Masterfile)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=blueberry+plants&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191109_1300%22","date":"20191109","image":{"name":"OHR.BlueberryFrost_EN-AU7426130997.jpg","hd":"/images/D1FC3F2886F248F242224303A1074F98B36A0D3225C08770C2B939FDD9AA7883.jpg","tmb":"/images/870B7ACE88D889C781F11439238D28B9EAB40E6866C2A16FF65BFA4A8B2575A4.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlueberryFrost_EN-AU7426130997_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlueberryFrost_EN-AU7426130997_tmb.jpg"}}
