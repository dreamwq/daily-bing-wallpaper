A display of 62,000 handcrafted flowers, The Poppy Project was the centrepiece of commemorations in 2018 for Western Australia’s war memorial - designed to symbolically represent Australian lives lost in the First World War. A few extra ‘fallen poppies’ were even crafted to help commemorate those who have been lost in wars since then.","copyright":"2018 Remembrance Day Poppy Project display of handcrafted poppies in Kings Park, Perth (© domonabike/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Remembrance+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191110_1300%22","date":"20191110","image":{"name":"OHR.PoppyProject_EN-AU7024619548.jpg","hd":"/images/207DCB3C15AFDBAE139DBE2DB7D6716EE29EE75B8CF5A121A29A90EDD24CF9F4.jpg","tmb":"/images/160D94DB2B4A14C27BEB4EC23753EC7D82C4DEE910633D4DF2528E746435C10C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PoppyProject_EN-AU7024619548_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PoppyProject_EN-AU7024619548_tmb.jpg"}}
