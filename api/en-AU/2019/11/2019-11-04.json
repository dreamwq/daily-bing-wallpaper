Unveiled back in 2002, Fed Square has seen more than 100 million visitors as it constantly shoots to fulfil the vision of becoming an internationally recognised contemporary world site and embrace the core values of Melbourne’s cultural foundations. Considering it’s been named the sixth best public square in the world, we’d say it’s doing pretty darn well.","copyright":"Federation Square, Flinders Street Station, trams and St-Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne (© Scott E Barbour/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Federation+Square+Melbourne&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191104_1300%22","date":"20191104","image":{"name":"OHR.FederationSquareMelbourne_EN-AU0912395617.jpg","hd":"/images/28B811BC58C7F2A31463279921B6BC4C9859A340CB4AEEDB008EFF2116D9C1D8.jpg","tmb":"/images/27A6227CE674E9C8BDB2407848774BEBB248361AAF3C092B5FA1136407338EE9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FederationSquareMelbourne_EN-AU0912395617_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FederationSquareMelbourne_EN-AU0912395617_tmb.jpg"}}
