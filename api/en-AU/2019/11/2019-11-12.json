Nazaré began attracting surfers to the area in the 1960s and has since become a major destination for men and women who want to surf some of the world's biggest waves. Nazaré's Praia do Norte (North Beach) is the site of the two latest records for largest wave ever surfed. The previous record was set by American Garrett McNamara on November 1, 2011, when he rode a 23-metre wave here. Then, on November 8, 2017, Koxa set a new record with this ride.","copyright":"Rodrigo Koxa riding the biggest wave ever surfed, on Nov 8, 2017, off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal (© Pedro Cruz/AP Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=nazare+surfing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191112_1300%22","date":"20191112","image":{"name":"OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-AU9986622435.jpg","hd":"/images/A6632EFB3C4627C5EF1388B069E54FF7BE6877D16453CBE93A70C74C86FD637A.jpg","tmb":"/images/480D4789B105335F1F360A217F0A2212BFD46B0D3713263CA0039401F00B3AE6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-AU9986622435_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BigWaveSurfing_EN-AU9986622435_tmb.jpg"}}
