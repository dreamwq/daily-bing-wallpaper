{"title":"The “cathedral” of the Cantabrian Sea","caption":"The “cathedral” of the Cantabrian Sea","desc":"The beach of As Catedrais (The Cathedrals) featured on today’s homepage is one of the most beautiful and mysterious in northern Spain. Close to the Galician town of Ribadeo, its proper name is Aguas Santas beach (Holy Waters). The Cathedrals gained its moniker, however, due to the arches growing from the sand tongue, which look like the buttresses of a Catholic church. They’re supposedly naturally carved by saltwater and wind over millions of years, while more superstitious locals believe there’s a door in this place connecting with the beyond.","copyright":"Las Catedrales beach, Galicia, Spain (© Davide Seddio/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=As+Catedrais+beach&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191127_1300%22","date":"20191127","image":{"name":"OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-AU3574288049.jpg","hd":"/images/737A2B12534FEF2C4D09E725A6A6A1387C646500FA835CDAEA8E4F65B4022A57.jpg","tmb":"/images/FB322F791810F02D955674866014B0CB4202D4D132766909EEFC15B118AC404E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-AU3574288049_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-AU3574288049_tmb.jpg"}}
