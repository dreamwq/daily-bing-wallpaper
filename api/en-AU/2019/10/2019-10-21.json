{"title":"Bobbing for crab apples","caption":"Bobbing for crab apples","desc":"It's apple season in the UK - the time for apple pie, apple cider, apple cake, caramel apples, or just biting into a fresh, crisp apple - especially one you picked yourself. There are more than 7,500 varieties of apples grown in the world, but this blackbird is enjoying a crab apple, which most people find a little sour to eat right off the tree. They do, however, work well for jam, apple butter, or even pie filling. The term 'crabapple' doesn’t refer to a specific species but is used for several types of small apples. In Celtic culture, crab apples are associated with love and marriage. Supposedly if you throw the seeds into a fire while saying the name of your love, the seeds explode if your love is true. We'd try it, but we're busy baking a pie.","copyright":"Blackbird eating a crab apple in a garden in Wiltshire, United Kingdom (© Nick Upton/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=apple+malus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191021_1300%22","date":"20191021","image":{"name":"OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-AU1529021349.jpg","hd":"/images/E270AFC7AFF48569D7699B65355ED5DCDD039B45F84C33F14FF3000BEC23DABB.jpg","tmb":"/images/F8CBA694C3EF6BF7A6C325B64393DC30851517BD8AD33B64DF37A23062F47C37.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-AU1529021349_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-AU1529021349_tmb.jpg"}}
