{"title":"Art in the high desert","caption":"Art in the high desert","desc":"The desert doubles as an art studio this week at Utah’s Arches National Park, as painters from all over congregate for the Red Rock Art Festival. This Moab-based event is a celebration of what the French call painting ‘en plein air,’ or painting outside. Sounds like a fabulous idea to us (and what a view!). The colourful landscape here at Arches National Park is home to the highest density of natural arches in the world - upwards of 2,000 - as well as more pinnacles and dramatically balanced rocks. Combine that with the fiery sunsets, pinyon trees, and splashes of sage and yucca, and we’d say these artists are in for a treat. Lucky for them, October is a pleasant time to visit the harsh, desert landscape.","copyright":"Arches National Park, Moab, Utah (© Whit Richardson/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Arches+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191010_1300%22","date":"20191010","image":{"name":"OHR.RedRocksArches_EN-AU7685657832.jpg","hd":"/images/10E82C76EFD944B646F270837DA3F766DFF97D875D1025ACD200D8F1E06BF8D9.jpg","tmb":"/images/10B632E7745D815FFA8D70EC640E31E99BCA94EC30BB7949D56C2D5F83008EA7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRocksArches_EN-AU7685657832_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRocksArches_EN-AU7685657832_tmb.jpg"}}
