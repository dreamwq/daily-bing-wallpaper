Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, also has the largest number of moons: 79. Jupiter is the Roman counterpart to Zeus, and so the planet’s major moons are named after Zeus', shall we say, extra-marital partners. So, when it came time to name NASA's most ambitious Jupiter probe, they decided to name it after his wife, Juno, so that she could keep an eye on him.","copyright":"Sequence of colour-enhanced images of Jupiter (© Enhanced Image by Gerald Eichstädt and Sean Doran, CC BY-NC-SA, based on images provided Courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=jupiter&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191003_1400%22","date":"20191003","image":{"name":"OHR.JupiterJunoCam_EN-AU7756058193.jpg","hd":"/images/C53AECFC4A076B128A184BB4645E2C53AAE7EBCE25B42CAA04C2C062A388E25A.jpg","tmb":"/images/0080731C4654E7CFFD8D7608CB3F0FA6D4F2A96778ED0512C944C4828D65BEFC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JupiterJunoCam_EN-AU7756058193_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JupiterJunoCam_EN-AU7756058193_tmb.jpg"}}
