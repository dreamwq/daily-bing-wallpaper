They come in such vast numbers that it’s thought to be one of the largest concentrations of mammals in the world. From the end of October to mid-December, these large fruit-eating bats pack into a small area in the forest to roost. But when the sun begins to set, they start to swarm, darkening the skies as they head out to gorge on fruit in the Mushitu swamp forest. Experts believe their migration starts about 3,200 kilometres north, in Congo.","copyright":"Straw-coloured fruit bats in Kasanka National Park, Zambia (© Nick Garbutt/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=straw-coloured+fruit+bats+kasanka+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191028_1300%22","date":"20191028","image":{"name":"OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-AU7305962377.jpg","hd":"/images/2022C0AC86BDC24192E252F3994D78D048EDFBB3B440BE1A5093F795D2A6F0E9.jpg","tmb":"/images/1085A8404C5BF5A9DCE89103AF76E758EC6F4F7758696F09FFCFC191E5B01159.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-AU7305962377_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-AU7305962377_tmb.jpg"}}
