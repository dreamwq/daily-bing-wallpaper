The building consists of three different elements: a medical building with spaces for patient care and research; the Life Activity Centre, a for-hire event space which helps fund the centre’s research; and a breezeway connecting the two spaces. Some have likened these elements to the hemispheres of the brain itself, with the medical building representing rational thinking and the event space giving form to creative thinking.","copyright":"Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Centre for Brain Health in Las Vegas, Nevada (© Garry Belinsky/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Cleveland+Clinic+Lou+Ruvo+Center+for+Brain+Health&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191006_1300%22","date":"20191006","image":{"name":"OHR.LouRuvo_EN-AU6786042089.jpg","hd":"/images/5A22E1EB5E0E13FBFB4F0AB549784A162A08FDAEAED4514A7D75464FD8A533A7.jpg","tmb":"/images/A9DFAA132EE980DBC12DF33908B487C4B08690793F9C9E712B09ED2AFDDAD622.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LouRuvo_EN-AU6786042089_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LouRuvo_EN-AU6786042089_tmb.jpg"}}
