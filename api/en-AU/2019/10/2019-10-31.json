{"title":"A photographic wonder","caption":"Spring pops up in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park","desc":"Just 450 km shy of Alice Springs lies one of the country’s most photogenic spring spots - Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. The now world-famous location gains its name from two of Australia’s most beloved sites: the truly jaw-dropping Uluru and the red domes of Kata Tjuta. But while you might think that the hot, arid environment would not be friendly to much nature, the World-Heritage listed park is surprisingly home to a wide array of rare plants and flowers. That fact alone makes it the perfect destination for spring lovers – just be sure to pack yourself a hat!","copyright":"Spring in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Australia (© Sabine Leuenberger/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Uluru+Kata+Tjuta+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191031_1300%22","date":"20191031","image":{"name":"OHR.SpringUluru_EN-AU4981934948.jpg","hd":"/images/5989E52428F346E841546044322C7C7689B3FA425C9AA86256F32A03E0C36B8D.jpg","tmb":"/images/43C15CE3943EB75ED518D5CB921617EAE330156DB7219D702D7860AC3F3123C8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpringUluru_EN-AU4981934948_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpringUluru_EN-AU4981934948_tmb.jpg"}}
