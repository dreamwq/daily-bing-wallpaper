In fact, aside from a small handful of insects, berries and honeydew, it’s the main source of sustenance for the native animal. Typically found in the southern areas of the country, the Red Wattlebird uses its thin, curved bill and brush-tipped tongue to probe its way into flowers and remove their tasty nectar. The bird’s love for nectar runs so deep that it’s even known to aggressively protect food-bearing plants from other honeyeater species. Seems we’re not the only ones capable of getting a little ‘hangry’.","copyright":"Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Victoria, Australia (© plainpicture/Minden Pictures/Jan Wegener/BIA)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Red+Wattlebird&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191014_1300%22","date":"20191014","image":{"name":"OHR.RedWattlebird_EN-AU9914385900.jpg","hd":"/images/31BC482AF6BCD0C79F551B87B95A03D54AB2882580F72439C2A867F5DC0FD93B.jpg","tmb":"/images/79B078B5CE329173F6AA50A1CF80CCF8AE148A323957C6A3C808DD74CFA1F2A7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedWattlebird_EN-AU9914385900_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedWattlebird_EN-AU9914385900_tmb.jpg"}}
