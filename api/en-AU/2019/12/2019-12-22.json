December 23 marks Festivus, a tongue-in-cheek observance created by writer Daniel O'Keefe. At first an O'Keefe family inside joke, Festivus was re-branded as a rejection of Christmas-season commercialism and written into a 1997 episode of 'Seinfeld' by Daniel's son Dan. The show introduced such goofy new traditions as the 'Airing of Grievances', 'Feats of Strength', and identifying 'Festivus miracles’.","copyright":"Gentoo penguins airing grievances in Antarctica (© Grafissimo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gentoo+penguin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191222_1300%22","date":"20191222","image":{"name":"OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-AU6097466212.jpg","hd":"/images/84DACA46DF1A1B26500ADBD0272CA90CD639D6FB68070C966405C8C184DD9D22.jpg","tmb":"/images/0AB5043A04DA0D742000234DF57F9A6F444D0F0B536EB4F66F7919CADF0CED2B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-AU6097466212_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-AU6097466212_tmb.jpg"}}
