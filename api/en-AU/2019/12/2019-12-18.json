{"title":"Christmas comes to Geelong","caption":"Christmas comes to Geelong","desc":"Australia might lack the snowy scenes common to much of the northern hemisphere, so today we’re embracing the warmth and taking you to Geelong, where the local community celebrates Christmas in classic Australian fashion – with a floating Christmas tree! Yes, running for its sixth year up until January 7 (to coincide with Orthodox Christmas), the tree is just a stone’s throw from the beloved Carousel, allowing locals and tourists alike to come together and marvel at its bright lights as the sun goes down. Visitors can enjoy a six-minute show that takes place four times an hour, and to encourage repeat visits, there are three variations of the show – each with a different light display and music track.","copyright":"Sunset over The Carousel Pavilion with Christmas tree, Geelong (© TonyNg/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=carousel+pavilion+geelong&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191218_1300%22","date":"20191218","image":{"name":"OHR.GeelongChristmas_EN-AU8356368393.jpg","hd":"/images/D53D3B7D43F804F62D376C5E6E937C387AE72595CC376678C4E0BBEE1F21D4A3.jpg","tmb":"/images/20A4D2550B970D89B6688D87B94E793B97FEE2FC8002B1C45CF406B4386C3422.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GeelongChristmas_EN-AU8356368393_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GeelongChristmas_EN-AU8356368393_tmb.jpg"}}
