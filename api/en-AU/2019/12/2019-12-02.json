{"title":"Summer vibes are back","caption":"Summer vibes are back","desc":"Can you think of a better way to welcome back summer than exploring one of the country’s most stunning beaches? Yes, today we visit Whitehaven beach - a Queensland beauty covered with some of the purest white silica sand in the world. Found on Whitsunday Island - the largest of the 74 islands in the Whitsundays region – the beach is spread over seven kilometres. That gives tourists and visitors plenty of space to indulge in a wide range of activities. Some will swim, while others snorkel, take a hike through the forest or laze about on the sand with a good book. We sure know where we’d rather be right now. Welcome back, summer, we missed you.","copyright":"Whitsunday Island, Whitehaven beach, Queensland (© Maurizio Rellini/Sime/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=whitehaven+beach&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191202_1300%22","date":"20191202","image":{"name":"OHR.WhitehavenBeachQueensland_EN-AU5575796516.jpg","hd":"/images/266F2E9110C01D57A018964CAE9E96FE753913AAF94FFAE678DF1AB568D2EDF2.jpg","tmb":"/images/56BFFF4FB690D3AAC94CCB785FA680020AA837F478936AF6177665B9BDA571E7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehavenBeachQueensland_EN-AU5575796516_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehavenBeachQueensland_EN-AU5575796516_tmb.jpg"}}
