Until the advent of macro- and micro-photography in the late 1800s, it was impossible to study the structure of snowflakes - they melted too quickly to be accurately sketched under a microscope. Enter Wilson 'Snowflake' Bentley. A farmer and self-trained scientist from Jericho, Vermont, Bentley was the first person to successfully photograph an individual snowflake. Over his lifetime, he would produce over 5,000 different images, a feat that led him to be the first to observe that every snowflake is unique.","copyright":"Snowflake (© TothGaborGyula/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=snowflake+(ice+crystal)&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191220_1300%22","date":"20191220","image":{"name":"OHR.RealSnowflake_EN-AU5642801397.jpg","hd":"/images/50C719668FEC7CFE43FB2AA68F0179635FBB9CB4CC601E74105B9AD249A0ECF7.jpg","tmb":"/images/CE0833329F713DF34C989847B82189F854BB0DC32F2F04FE0A685DFEE62890F1.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RealSnowflake_EN-AU5642801397_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RealSnowflake_EN-AU5642801397_tmb.jpg"}}
