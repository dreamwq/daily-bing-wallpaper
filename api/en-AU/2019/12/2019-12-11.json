{"title":"On the lookout for Sheep-Cote Clod","caption":"On the lookout for Sheep-Cote Clod","desc":"You're looking at one of the oldest breeds of sheep in the world. Icelandic sheep descended from short-tailed sheep brought to the island from Norway in the ninth and tenth century with the first wave of settlers. These sheep, with their dual-layer woolly coats, thrive in this harsh environment, outnumbering people in Iceland by more than a factor of two. But on December 12, these sheep, especially the ewes, will have to contend with something more invasive than the wind chill factor. Sheep-Cote Clod, the first of the 13 Yule Lads, is due to visit.","copyright":"Icelandic sheep for the first night of the Yule Lads (Â© John Porter LRPS/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=icelandic+sheep&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191211_1300%22","date":"20191211","image":{"name":"OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-AU6617725758.jpg","hd":"/images/ABEFDEAF1EC1251EE0DF15F2C4FB03FEBB5A3731E01BA26045896DCDD4B7260C.jpg","tmb":"/images/D35FC35A026E1FCDBD43B69F7DCD13AB0C7C8CD11C2A1F83DFB9337203F6C19C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-AU6617725758_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-AU6617725758_tmb.jpg"}}
