Ama Dablam means 'mother's necklace': Its swooping shape is thought to evoke a mother cradling a child, and a dangling glacier on its southwest face is believed to resemble the religious pendants many Sherpa women wear. Situated in the nearby Khumbu Valley, Tengboche Monastery is a stop on the Sacred Sites Trail Project, a self-guided trek through holy places that dot Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park.","copyright":"Tengboche Monastery in the Himalayan Mountains, Nepal (Â© Kyle Hammons/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=tengboche+monastery+nepal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191210_1300%22","date":"20191210","image":{"name":"OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-AU6422306165.jpg","hd":"/images/352684D35DAFD035F76596330004388668D45740BA71E26ABBDE4C10B3153E76.jpg","tmb":"/images/F46931E4050548721C72B75F77874BDE5B96AB39659AF3C71E2939F2E6858499.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-AU6422306165_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TengbocheMonastery_EN-AU6422306165_tmb.jpg"}}
