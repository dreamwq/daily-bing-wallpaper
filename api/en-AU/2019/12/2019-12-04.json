If you were to visit a farm like this, however, it's unlikely you'd find much peace and quiet. Of the 25 million to 30 million natural Christmas trees sold each year in America alone, 98 per cent of them come from farms. 'Tis the season for tree chopping, it seems. Plenty of similar farms exist across Australia as well, due to the fact that pine trees aren’t native to our shores. However, Canada remains the world's largest exporter of Christmas trees, spreading holiday cheer around the world.","copyright":"Christmas tree farm in Ontario, Canada (© FatCamera/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=christmas+tree+farm+cultivation&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191204_1300%22","date":"20191204","image":{"name":"OHR.CanadaTreeFarm_EN-AU5417962419.jpg","hd":"/images/848D1725BC39E4873B7CAD21D96196CB23B00FFA685426F69488FA9961A2FB0F.jpg","tmb":"/images/40FA760FC512C5EC60E943156409E265EB135338416BCF770AE526B8691BBD43.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaTreeFarm_EN-AU5417962419_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaTreeFarm_EN-AU5417962419_tmb.jpg"}}
