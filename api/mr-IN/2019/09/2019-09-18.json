Although places like the Diu Fort or the Nagoa Beach are what are most frequently visited by tourists, the caves and quarries of Diu are a wonderful place to try some photography, simply because of the unusual play of light, like what you see on today’s homepage. A short walk from the main town, the Naida caves are well worth a visit. These are not natural caves; in fact they are abandoned Portuguese stone quarries.","copyright":"A quarry in Diu (© LEROY Francis/hemis.fr/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=diu+quarry&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190918_1830%22","date":"20190918","image":{"name":"OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150.jpg","hd":"/images/AE86347AEC32FDCE603429013838C9276BA7D01701F98DAEA66DC1168412DA50.jpg","tmb":"/images/6D96C15F58E44192848E3230B988C11D40922C8CDB3464B774521D4087E234B7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150_tmb.jpg"}}
