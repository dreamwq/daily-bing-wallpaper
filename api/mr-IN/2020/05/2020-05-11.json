May 12, 2020 is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the 'Lady with the Lamp' credited with reinventing and modernising the profession of nursing. Born into a wealthy English family living in Italy, she spurned the traditional Victorian role of wife and hostess to embark on a career in nursing and social reform. After training as a nurse in Germany and serving as one in London, her friend and confidant, War Secretary Sidney Herbert, sent Nightingale and staff of 38 women she had trained as nurses to help care for the wounded of the Crimean War.","copyright":"Birth anniversary of  Florence Nightingale observed in India, 2015 (© NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=international+nurses+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200511_1830%22","date":"20200511","image":{"name":"OHR.NightingaleIndia2_EN-IN8843525980.jpg","hd":"/images/464C14C795BA10DD4F9F2DC7BD4F4CB508DD69DA592B97609FB76D0BB0F0FD73.jpg","tmb":"/images/5D001A1AA3987C06525F79059F2EDDE00E6214E7D0F15820716F3CC9ED7933EE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NightingaleIndia2_EN-IN8843525980_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NightingaleIndia2_EN-IN8843525980_tmb.jpg"}}
