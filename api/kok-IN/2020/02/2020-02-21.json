On February 22 and October 22 (thought to be Ramesses' coronation and birth dates, respectively), the first light of dawn illuminates the sanctuary and three statues within: one of Ramesses, one of the sun god Ra, and one of the chief god Amun. A fourth statue depicting the underworld figure Ptah is permanently shrouded in shadow.","copyright":"The interior of the Great Temple of Ramesses II, Abu Simbel, Egypt (© Nick Brundle Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=abu+simbel&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200221_1830%22","date":"20200221","image":{"name":"OHR.AbuSimbelSunFest_EN-IN1402106864.jpg","hd":"/images/6C0C7E1DCD0E61372F524FD21FEBC7D63E11679B4A601D28CDBA7241511C3B3A.jpg","tmb":"/images/14E4EC3EECBE60C488D04EBFA3DFC281E88659038C656DEB53600F8A52108159.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbuSimbelSunFest_EN-IN1402106864_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbuSimbelSunFest_EN-IN1402106864_tmb.jpg"}}
