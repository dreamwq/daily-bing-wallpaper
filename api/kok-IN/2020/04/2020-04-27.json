{"title":"Happy 800th, Salisbury Cathedral","caption":"Happy 800th, Salisbury Cathedral","desc":"We're in the English county of Wiltshire to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Salisbury Cathedral—the towering marvel of Early English Gothic design rising behind these contentedly grazing sheep. The massive church's first foundation stones were laid here in Salisbury—then called New Sarum—on April 28, 1220. The structure itself dates back even further, the bulk of it having been moved over 1500 metres piece by piece from the former Roman stronghold of Old Sarum.","copyright":"Salisbury Cathedral with grazing flock of sheep, England (© Slawek Staszczuk Photo/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=salisbury+cathedral&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200427_1830%22","date":"20200427","image":{"name":"OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-IN5618277899.jpg","hd":"/images/FE3B9A08B7F9DE8BEDFE98ADDFA72D7ED1EE3836BB9D982FCBE0DBA5E076632D.jpg","tmb":"/images/B9E4B70C382F7F45BD694F24B1CF60512B15A4894C39F5B5E34DFF585C946458.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-IN5618277899_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-IN5618277899_tmb.jpg"}}
