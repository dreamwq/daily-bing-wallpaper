The LN was founded on January 10, 1920, after World War I. It served as an international diplomatic organisation until World War II, when it gradually lost support and was eventually replaced by the United Nations. The Palace, built to be the LN's headquarters, has served as UN headquarters in Geneva and hosts diplomats for thousands of meetings every year.","copyright":"Flags outside the UN's Palace of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland (Â© Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=palace+of+nations+in+geneva+switzerland&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200109_1830%22","date":"20200109","image":{"name":"OHR.LeagueNations_EN-IN3687733805.jpg","hd":"/images/70A0B73B30ED3508DB7BA70F28417B002EF087D3503849724F0545E636502761.jpg","tmb":"/images/20D07CAA75E4E32F27FB5FAB25BE670AAE7F80240A8CB889C23878809EC318A0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeagueNations_EN-IN3687733805_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeagueNations_EN-IN3687733805_tmb.jpg"}}
