{"title":"A festival of new beginnings","caption":"A festival of new beginnings","desc":"Today is the first day of the New Year according to the Hindu lunisolar calendar (the first day of the month Chaitra). In other words, it’s Gudi Padwa festival day in Maharashtra and Goa, while other southern states celebrate the same day as Ugadi, or Yugadi. The word Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit ‘Yuga’ (age) and ‘adi’ (beginning). While different states might be prone to different traditions and different savouries prepared for the celebrations, one aspect of the celebrations remains common – the colourful floor designs made of powder - both small and gigantic scale, as you see in today’s homepage.","copyright":"Preparation of Gudi Padwa festival in Mumbai, Maharashtra (© Praful Gangurde/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gudi+padwa+festival&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200324_1830%22","date":"20200324","image":{"name":"OHR.PadwaPowder_EN-IN1893350648.jpg","hd":"/images/0E0FA6309117AB93C8AA4C3CCFE465F1D7776A351A6E43B50B935292C342A0B8.jpg","tmb":"/images/5B627BE553C4E64AA13D3C27B434C2E95C4261DF95AA75B56D914432A66517B7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PadwaPowder_EN-IN1893350648_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PadwaPowder_EN-IN1893350648_tmb.jpg"}}
