{"title":"Swimming with the sea cows","caption":"Swimming with the sea cows","desc":"In observance of Manatee Awareness Month, we’re swimming through a clear Florida river in the US, with these friendly sea cows. Generally solitary animals, they are also known to be curious and will approach boats. That's why the US government enforces special speed zones for watercraft, particularly as the manatees are on the move to warmer areas to spend the winter. While manatees have no known natural predators, they remain a vulnerable species due to loss of habitat and collisions with boats.","copyright":"Manatees in the Ichetucknee River in Florida, USA.
