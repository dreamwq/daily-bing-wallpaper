Quebec City, one of North America’s oldest European settlements, is often called the most European city outside Europe. It's the only North American city outside Mexico whose fortified walls still stand, and its winding streets showcase a French-tinged exemplar of old Romantic architecture (typified by the steep-roofed Château Frontenac in the photo's foreground).","copyright":"View of the Old City in Quebec City, Canada (© RENAULT Philippe/age fotostock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=old+city+in+quebec+city&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200206_1830%22","date":"20200206","image":{"name":"OHR.QuebecWinter_EN-IN0863263493.jpg","hd":"/images/89D7D334F39D19B545E26C1A505601BE003190197353E9EA81225DED3334CAC3.jpg","tmb":"/images/A9CC9741950B7D0C839D8A7BA572A9AFEAD28170145C06AC389FE0FB4A45F374.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QuebecWinter_EN-IN0863263493_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QuebecWinter_EN-IN0863263493_tmb.jpg"}}
