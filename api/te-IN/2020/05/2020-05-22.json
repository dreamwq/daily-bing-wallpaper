In other words, it is the last day of the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. For the last one month, Muslims around the world have been fasting from sunrise to sunset, breaking their fast with the sighting of the moon followed by the first meal of the day at ‘Iftar’. The month of Ramadan is observed as a commemoration of the Prophet Mohammed’s revelation. The annual fast is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam, and is observed from the sighting of the crescent moon at the beginning this month, up until the next sighting of the crescent moon (which is today).","copyright":"Crescent moon behind the Jama Masjid, New Delhi (© Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=ramadan+&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200522_1830%22","date":"20200522","image":{"name":"OHR.RamadanSpire_EN-IN1980481208.jpg","hd":"/images/9875D0F706D5B1D3BB22AFD2C9283B7DB0FBD6EAB696A86E8C21F1BEE83C14E3.jpg","tmb":"/images/5AF93ACBC907AC1D47E23BCE2701F13BB4F52DA2D3B0DD2F775D24AA35A505EF.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RamadanSpire_EN-IN1980481208_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RamadanSpire_EN-IN1980481208_tmb.jpg"}}
