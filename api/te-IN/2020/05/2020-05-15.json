{"title":"Beautiful lake in the Pyrenees mountains","caption":"Beautiful lake in the Pyrenees mountains","desc":"The lakes of Ayous are quite a marvel on the border between France and Spain. Nestled in the heart of the Pyrenees mountains, this set of six lakes is a setting unparalleled for hikers and nature lovers alike. In these uncertain times, hiking is not necessarily at the top of the list of priorities but hope is allowed - nothing prevents you from dreaming about what you can do in the future! In our image today, we see the peak of Ossau, 2,884 meters above sea level - and Lake Ayous, also called Lake Roumassot. Lake Ayous covers an area of 5.1 hectares and, in some places, can reach a depth of 16 metres; something to cool in, off after hours of walking.","copyright":"Lac d'Ayous hut with Midi d'Ossau mountain, France (Â© Eneko Aldaz/Offset by Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=lac+d%27ayous&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200515_1830%22","date":"20200515","image":{"name":"OHR.LacMidi_EN-IN1984585942.jpg","hd":"/images/F7996AEF823BE5B69642346C9D128D011655425B085445648909E7C717BA243C.jpg","tmb":"/images/620528A0785E01FFDAC88472EF25678412E16C40E4319002F2A7A53DD9F663B2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LacMidi_EN-IN1984585942_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LacMidi_EN-IN1984585942_tmb.jpg"}}
