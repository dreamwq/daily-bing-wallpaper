The Twist seems like an intrusion from the future amidst the dense woods and preserved historic buildings of Javneker, Norway, home to the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park. The Twist is a bridge, but also an art gallery. Its unique construction features straight slats set at increasing angles as one moves toward the centre—'like a stack of books,' as its architects at the Bjarke Ingels Group describe it—to create a 90-degree turn where a wall becomes the ceiling and vice versa.","copyright":"At the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park in Norway, The Twist bridges the Randselva River via a multipurpose walkway (© Laurian Ghinitoiu)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=kistefos+museum+sculpture+park+norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200330_1830%22","date":"20200330","image":{"name":"OHR.TheTwist_EN-IN1903032043.jpg","hd":"/images/593F5DE87F89D54759557C8C54F404937E8F9998513B3A8B438F8BD9222CEBEE.jpg","tmb":"/images/23640C6387184105931B0FEE1EC463B2B634D78411E11CC18610750156D2AB43.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheTwist_EN-IN1903032043_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheTwist_EN-IN1903032043_tmb.jpg"}}
