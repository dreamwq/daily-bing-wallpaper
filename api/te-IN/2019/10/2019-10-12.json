{"title":"Paleontology meets art","caption":"Paleontology meets art","desc":"Though it looks like a fresco from Ancient Greece, this is the fossilised remains of a fern found in Córdoba, Spain. The fossil dates back to the Carboniferous period, roughly 350 million years ago. This is a ‘compression fossil’—where a small amount of the original plant material was retained with the mineral deposits that help form the impression. Why all the paleobotany talk? It’s National Fossil Day in the US, a day that was established to promote the value of fossils - and we’re excited! Whether you make a trip to your local natural history museum, trek off to a national park with a fossil exhibit, or just look at fossil photos on the web, we hope you find a fun way to celebrate the day with us.","copyright":"A fossilized carboniferous fern (© Juan Carlos Munoz/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=national+fossil+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191012_1830%22","date":"20191012","image":{"name":"OHR.CompressionFossil_EN-IN7288825779.jpg","hd":"/images/B3CA4A746623FE07BEE5E84FDD4861EB147935167DFCB50006A1FAF224C13938.jpg","tmb":"/images/0FE3D8DFF469DF9E97023D12E595A2004D1E5BC1FE701F11F6172E972EC8ABFA.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CompressionFossil_EN-IN7288825779_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CompressionFossil_EN-IN7288825779_tmb.jpg"}}
