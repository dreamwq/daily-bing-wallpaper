{"title":"'Have fun storming the castle'","caption":"'Have fun storming the castle'","desc":"Our headline quote comes from 'The Princess Bride' film, of course, but our homepage castle is found in Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states (the others are Latvia and Estonia). Construction on this fortress was begun in the 14th century by the Grand Duke of Lithuania and completed years later by his son. It served as a strategic and bustling center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a European state that lasted until 1795. Like much architecture from so long ago, the castle was damaged and fell into disrepair, only to be reconstructed and reopened as a museum. These days it's known as one of the most charming medieval castles in Europe.","copyright":"Trakai Island Castle Museum in Trakai, Lithuania (Â© Andrius Aleksandravicius/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Trakai+Island+Castle&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200106_0800%22","date":"20200106","image":{"name":"OHR.TrakaiLithuania_EN-US8531258766.jpg","hd":"/images/B41E2DC5716D25FC819F2874E52F371BD0A3ABA5F68569F87C1460B60B4E5DEB.jpg","tmb":"/images/5A7E6768727DBAFC3A792CA65FA55F8F9C650A8C6987FA0EF677EDB04AC83ECE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrakaiLithuania_EN-US8531258766_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrakaiLithuania_EN-US8531258766_tmb.jpg"}}
