{"title":"Dance of the egret","caption":"Dance of the egret","desc":"They say, 'Dance like nobody's watching,' but here in Florida, this reddish egret could very likely have an audience of birders. The species has a reputation for bold, energetic feeding behavior that can resemble a frenetic dance. As it stalks its prey in shallow water, the reddish egret is prone to prance, stagger, and leap, while strategically positioning its wings to block the glare of the sun and boldly stab at fish. It's one of many species that make Florida a year-round delight for birdwatchers.","copyright":"A reddish egret hunts in Fort De Soto Park, Florida (Â© Brian Lasenby/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Reddish+egret&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200131_0800%22","date":"20200131","image":{"name":"OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-US2958831498.jpg","hd":"/images/145DCDAE0A2EA86F9B4242BB7654CD2514B81601D0F24C61881152603C665905.jpg","tmb":"/images/CD040160BA3786360B362C3BF856456085A87BA0168897B90D1E437B4A28CD7C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-US2958831498_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReddishEgret_EN-US2958831498_tmb.jpg"}}
