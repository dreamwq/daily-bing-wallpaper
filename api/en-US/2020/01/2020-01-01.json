{"title":"Napping away New Year's Day","caption":"Napping away New Year's Day","desc":"This mountain hare is starting the year off right. It's used to cold weather and high altitudes—and, since it's nocturnal, it's perfectly comfortable sleeping through an afternoon snowstorm in northeast Scotland. On New Year's Day, humans in the US are more likely to be found in their natural habitat, the couch, dozing off or perhaps watching one of the college football bowl games on TV. Some more ambitious folks might be getting a jump on their New Year's resolutions and exercising. First Day Hikes are part of an initiative led by state parks, with hundreds of free guided hikes offered in all 50 states. That sounds great, but maybe a little later. Right now, we think the hare has the right idea.","copyright":"A mountain hare hunkers down in a snowstorm, the Cairngorms, Scotland (© Lyle McCalmont/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mountain+hare&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200101_0800%22","date":"20200101","image":{"name":"OHR.SnowHare_EN-US4373999242.jpg","hd":"/images/0751D1516DB6D3985B9A7B8EB783A6BD87489C899201F7D6C24B4CF561A4C8E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/596C221B1A1CA7202CF924FA92AF44715CA21A557C676A6510D6B901473D0313.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowHare_EN-US4373999242_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowHare_EN-US4373999242_tmb.jpg"}}
