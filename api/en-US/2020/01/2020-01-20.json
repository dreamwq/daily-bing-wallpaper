Among those in the front line of demonstrators are baseball great Jackie Robinson and bus-boycott activist Rosa Parks, both towering figures in the civil rights movement. Later this day, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. would deliver his 'I Have a Dream' speech in front of a quarter-million protesters packed onto the National Mall. The speech is considered among the best in American history and a defining moment in the fight for civil rights. King was just 34 years old.","copyright":"The front line of demonstrators during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 (Â© Steve Schapiro/Corbis via Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=martin+luther+king+jr+day+federal+holiday+&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200120_0800%22","date":"20200120","image":{"name":"OHR.MarchWA1963_EN-US7913146423.jpg","hd":"/images/6A045E0DB5721FE2F7CC2B8A34005FD2961BB6097EC3D27B513F912E7011AC75.jpg","tmb":"/images/7310801A7545DCD6816F3744D673F5C9CEBFE2D923DD563DAE2D4B836D1CA4E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarchWA1963_EN-US7913146423_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarchWA1963_EN-US7913146423_tmb.jpg"}}
