{"title":"Harvest season begins","caption":"Harvest season begins","desc":"Today we're in Kathmandu, Nepal, where the Boudhanath stupa stands out against the skyline. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the stupa is on the ancient trade route from Tibet—traders have rested and offered prayers here for centuries. Like all stupas, Boudhanath is a mound-like structure containing relics. It was first built sometime after the 600s, when Buddhism was first spreading through Tibet and Nepal. It's long been a major pilgrimage site for Buddhists, and is said to entomb the remains of Kassapa Buddha, one of the 29 named ancient Buddhas.","copyright":"Aerial view of Boudhanath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal (© Maksim Semin/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=boudhanath+stupa+nepal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200115_0800%22","date":"20200115","image":{"name":"OHR.Boudhanath_EN-US9594857498.jpg","hd":"/images/390C2E8272F22E00A2EDD30146561072DB6F78E3D8F8A2A2845613E6F7FD5CBA.jpg","tmb":"/images/A7183E13409E3C641F16D17160DB1AF9F0CB4612C17788241B376204C08BE6CC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Boudhanath_EN-US9594857498_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Boudhanath_EN-US9594857498_tmb.jpg"}}
