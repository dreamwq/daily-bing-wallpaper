Titled 'Field of Light,' it's currently on display at a venue called Sensorio in Paso Robles, California, the latest stop in a tour of sites around the world. At Sensorio, a new arts center that bills itself as representing 'the intersection of art, technology and nature,' visitors will find 58,800 solar-powered spheres, lit by optical fibers, that change color. When the sun sets, the fibers illuminate, creating a shimmering, interactive landscape in the meadow. The art installation changes a bit at each site, but Munro tells reporters, 'The one constant is that it does make people smile.'","copyright":"'Field of Light at Sensorio,' by Bruce Munro, Paso Robles, California (Â© George Rose/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Field+of+Light+by+Bruce+Munro&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200103_0800%22","date":"20200103","image":{"name":"OHR.MunroLight_EN-US7297129449.jpg","hd":"/images/7E083CAEAA430659738AEBD6A687BBF7BC0A690632F97B26117C01CE3645DD0F.jpg","tmb":"/images/5AF69D596FFA49A8211EE73CB90F7FBCD3059505FE1FB56A4D12324F55FF726C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-US7297129449_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MunroLight_EN-US7297129449_tmb.jpg"}}
