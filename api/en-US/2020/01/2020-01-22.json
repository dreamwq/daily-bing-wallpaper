The area enjoys frequent and spectacular light shows, thanks to the aurora borealis. The mechanics of northern lights are still not fully understood, but scientists agree that solar winds—big pulses of energy from our sun—pass through the Earth's magnetic fields, especially at the polar regions, resulting in shimmering colors.","copyright":"Northern lights near Whitehorse in Yukon, Canada (© Design Pics/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=northern+lights+aurora+borealis&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200122_0800%22","date":"20200122","image":{"name":"OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-US8047937950.jpg","hd":"/images/7D8193F937F06C9DEE4AC601775A021D575261E788D485C637C6985ECD0C55EB.jpg","tmb":"/images/387B95D1D3F0CFB1FD3817D459B44E3223328319403843889E248FABC5DBAF9F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-US8047937950_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhitehorseLights_EN-US8047937950_tmb.jpg"}}
