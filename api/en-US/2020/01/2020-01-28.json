How did Cape Disappointment get its name? A British fur trader in 1788 mistook the mouth of the Columbia River for a bay and was disappointed because his ship couldn't pass due to the river's shallow bar. Many ships would eventually sink in these dangerous waters, but this lighthouse has warned off countless others since it was lit in 1856, making it the first lighthouse in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the lighthouses in the US have been built and maintained by the US Coast Guard and its predecessors.","copyright":"Cape Disappointment Lighthouse in Ilwaco, Washington, for the formation of the modern US Coast Guard (Â© Tom Schwabel/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=cape+disappointment+lighthouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200128_0800%22","date":"20200128","image":{"name":"OHR.CapeDisappointment_EN-US8548904341.jpg","hd":"/images/E3AE692863AD905775F97B2DA2852C55C6A0B03A0F2093E3027BA3756F27EB06.jpg","tmb":"/images/AC059AFF381E9242067D75C92F124652B763D66710A31BF41BD22ACC57D9CC45.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapeDisappointment_EN-US8548904341_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapeDisappointment_EN-US8548904341_tmb.jpg"}}
