You're probably wondering: Shouldn't this crowd of penguins be social distancing right now? A smart observation, but the new coronavirus actually hasn't been observed in Antarctica at all (it's the only continent with no cases), nor have birds been shown to spread it. So, we're giving these avian gatherers a pass, but we encourage you to stay safe at home. With care and patience, we'll get back to enjoying each other's company just like these feathered friends.","copyright":"A nesting colony of king penguins in South Georgia, Antarctica (© Ralph Lee Hopkins/National Geographic/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=us+census+2020&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200401_0700%22","date":"20200401","image":{"name":"OHR.CensusDay_EN-US9512023842.jpg","hd":"/images/F33A875F315B948CAC984672304FE1C9947F80512D9AE36DA0E27EC92D9E43F7.jpg","tmb":"/images/55BBDD04AE17ECFED3871F1A277F208112CEA304FD4BB835C08CCD3E26CC6ADC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CensusDay_EN-US9512023842_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CensusDay_EN-US9512023842_tmb.jpg"}}
