{"title":"The frog prince?","caption":"The frog prince?","desc":"Perched among the petals of a purple water lily, we think this petite tree frog makes a fine mascot for National Frog Month. The annual event celebrates frogs around the world, all 4,000+ species. Among the various kinds, the little green tree frog is commonly found in the backyards and water features of the southeastern United States. It was named the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia. Not bad for a little tree frog who likes flowers.","copyright":"Green tree frog and water lily, Lake Kissimmee, Florida (Â© Joanne Williams/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Green+tree+frog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200405_0700%22","date":"20200405","image":{"name":"OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-US2219789542.jpg","hd":"/images/3211C9B485019AE2C8007989A59D87447C10A1A4B30E497EC136722A24568998.jpg","tmb":"/images/08F9035776C0EED3169142FE69F8133DCD5A3A7735C4187E6D68ABF67D9CF0E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-US2219789542_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-US2219789542_tmb.jpg"}}
