The literal translation of 'keukenhof'—from Dutch to English—is 'kitchen court,' since the original grounds for the park and flower garden began as a vegetable garden for the royal residents of Keuken Castle during the 15th century. This prompted another nickname for the pastoral spot: 'kitchen garden.'","copyright":"Keukenhof in Lisse, Netherlands (© Jim Zuckerman/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=keukenhof&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200420_0700%22","date":"20200420","image":{"name":"OHR.GardenHolland_EN-US6082654561.jpg","hd":"/images/85994C67A35E9DCEEDDF5B198E1ADEFF8BD7A48EE81AC91166153A77ED6DE363.jpg","tmb":"/images/291F19C65A560EFA5D43C706E92DD8CBCCAED8D17180CD1AFB5300184DD4CDBE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GardenHolland_EN-US6082654561_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GardenHolland_EN-US6082654561_tmb.jpg"}}
