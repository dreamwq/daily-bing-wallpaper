For National Submarine Day, we're in the forward engine room of the USS Drum, a historic US Navy submarine displayed at Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Alabama. The Drum was the first deployed of the Gato-class subs—the line of boats that, with variations, made up most of the US submarine force during World War II. Decommissioned shortly after the war, the submarine is now in dry dock and open for public tours.","copyright":"Forward engine room of the USS Drum, a Gato-class submarine at Battleship Memorial Park, Mobile, Alabama (© Warren Weinstein/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=uss+drum+submarine&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200411_0700%22","date":"20200411","image":{"name":"OHR.USSDRUM_EN-US6342955990.jpg","hd":"/images/431CD7A5DF3DE931FFCC0DC087FCDCB0DE334811558EA3529EDC4BB33D45FED9.jpg","tmb":"/images/FD1DD395351D1A1EAD0EEF2F83D6ED672FCAD3CD4AE3BF1E838C47D96A03DD5F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.USSDRUM_EN-US6342955990_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.USSDRUM_EN-US6342955990_tmb.jpg"}}
