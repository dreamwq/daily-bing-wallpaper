But the other rings are home to various microorganisms that produce bands of distinct colors ranging from green to orange to red.","copyright":"The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (© Martin Rügner/DEEPOL by plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=grand+prismatic+spring+yellowstone&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200421_0700%22","date":"20200421","image":{"name":"OHR.GPS_EN-US1004072291.jpg","hd":"/images/EB825DA1E4D29E7877CA397EB1790FB487F358CB54D77B0B54744D65B99DD5AC.jpg","tmb":"/images/9866B68B30CAA7D624BDE46D72AF3F1703E9F07812583116278036B3C4ADA22A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-US1004072291_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-US1004072291_tmb.jpg"}}
