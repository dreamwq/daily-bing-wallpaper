To honor the mythical horned beast, we bring you the next best thing: a pod of narwhals brandishing their tusks in the Arctic Ocean. Narwhals develop only two teeth, but—in males especially—the left canine can grow into a 9-foot-long spiraled tusk. The tusk juts right through the narwhal's upper lip, lending the whale the nickname 'unicorn of the sea.'","copyright":"A pod of narwhals near Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada (© Eric Baccega/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=narwhal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200409_0700%22","date":"20200409","image":{"name":"OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-US2782700254.jpg","hd":"/images/719B77DCC9520A66079C24F334DC51D0F641539C8A548A76AB12D5539D778366.jpg","tmb":"/images/7454CD1A1A58F6D26020BB2EBF7FBE0346CBADA4BFD265E3EE4B0C183A3E5418.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-US2782700254_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnicornoftheSea_EN-US2782700254_tmb.jpg"}}
