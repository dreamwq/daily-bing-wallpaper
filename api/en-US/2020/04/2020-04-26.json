A few miles from the shore is Destruction Island, where birds such as rhinoceros auklets may stop and rest after a day of gobbling up krill and squid in the cold Pacific waters. While the park includes miles of colorful Pacific coastline, it's also famous for the Hoh Rainforest, an inland temperate forest notable for its towering old-growth hemlock and spruce trees.","copyright":"Sunset at Ruby Beach in Olympic National Park, Washington state (Â© Adam Mowery/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ruby+Beach+Olympic+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200426_0700%22","date":"20200426","image":{"name":"OHR.RubySunset_EN-US0913610079.jpg","hd":"/images/47E6155E4642FFCD28ACE74769D99D60601B27C2793B3277492DFFAEE57B9B8C.jpg","tmb":"/images/9895750B510583758932DA59A7D2B27A6D6A39C8A6DB43BC9A03AF11C17DFAE4.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RubySunset_EN-US0913610079_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RubySunset_EN-US0913610079_tmb.jpg"}}
