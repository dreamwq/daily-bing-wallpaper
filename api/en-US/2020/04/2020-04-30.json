{"title":"What kind of bird laid these eggs?","caption":"What kind of bird laid these eggs?","desc":"These colorful little eggs are the progeny of the hoary redpoll, also known as the Arctic redpoll because of its extreme northern habitat. This hardy finch spends much of its time, including breeding season, in the brushy tundra of the northern polar regions. Because of the extreme cold, the female will often line her nest with feathers, particularly white ptarmigan feathers, as these appear to be. Sighting a hoary redpoll is a rare treat. The bird doesn't exactly migrate, but in winter it will sometimes fly short distances farther south in search of food, so if you live in Minnesota, North Dakota, or Montana, you might get a peek at one on your bird feeder. You’ll recognize a hoary redpoll by its small yellow bill, red cap, dark face, and 'frosty' white underbody streaked with brown. Or listen for the 'chif chif chif' of its call.","copyright":"Hoary redpoll nest in Lapland, Finland (© Maximilian Buzun/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=arctic+redpoll&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200430_0700%22","date":"20200430","image":{"name":"OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-US5881398714.jpg","hd":"/images/06DB8E898EF2DD4172740E13DE535E96153ABB8A2361AE77630667EEF92B7F83.jpg","tmb":"/images/6383908C4C3804A98D0938749FB846C5F7D38F31A27971057C2034B74F498403.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-US5881398714_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-US5881398714_tmb.jpg"}}
