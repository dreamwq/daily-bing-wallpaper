{"title":"Midwinter freeze","caption":"Midwinter freeze","desc":"Abiqua Falls in Oregon is a beautiful example of a basalt column amphitheater. Over 90 percent of all volcanic rock is basalt, but only a small fraction of it forms into the hexagonal columns that you see here. When molten lava hits the atmosphere, rapid cooling causes it to contract into these characteristic columns. It's just part of what makes Abiqua Falls so spectacular.","copyright":"Frozen amphitheater of columnar basalt walls flanking Abiqua Falls, Oregon (Â© Joshua Meador/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=abiqua+falls+oregon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200213_0800%22","date":"20200213","image":{"name":"OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-US4408914137.jpg","hd":"/images/4E073C35BDD2FB2F24D94E1F3883BFA0B6679184C3C37396C9689FD9640E933F.jpg","tmb":"/images/1589101225C96CFC30678E01A0C1121B60342BC961F902B48B5B1039D668D4BC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-US4408914137_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-US4408914137_tmb.jpg"}}
