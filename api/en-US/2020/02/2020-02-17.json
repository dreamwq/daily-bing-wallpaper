{"title":"Happy Presidents Day","caption":"Happy Presidents Day","desc":"It's hard to imagine a more appropriate place to celebrate Presidents Day than here, at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. The monument features four of our most famous presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Four hundred workers using dynamite, hammers, and chisels crafted these 60-foot-high sculptures out of the granite mountainside in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Work on the monument began in 1927 and was completed in 1941.","copyright":"Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota (© Tony Austin/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mount+rushmore&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200217_0800%22","date":"20200217","image":{"name":"OHR.MRNMSD_EN-US1457690831.jpg","hd":"/images/6C0FD33645389CF63163F7F22DED555F69FB3ECE99ABE11860C488803CF13EE0.jpg","tmb":"/images/BEAB01E098A4BA25E7FF89ABC1FAE419FF3274BB4DA37CC0F9E3DFDA1473BF3E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MRNMSD_EN-US1457690831_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MRNMSD_EN-US1457690831_tmb.jpg"}}
