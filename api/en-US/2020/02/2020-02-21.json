The larger-than-life 'bonecos de Olinda' kick off the festivities each year and have been part of the celebrations here for over a century. They can be up to 20 feet tall and weigh around 45 pounds each. But Carnival in Olinda is not only about these incredible puppets. Like other Carnival celebrations in Brazil, Olinda's features music, dancing, costumes, and fun.","copyright":"Giant puppets for Carnival in Olinda, Brazil (Â© Pulsar Imagens/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=olinda+brazil+carnival&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200221_0800%22","date":"20200221","image":{"name":"OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-US7914915440.jpg","hd":"/images/01395E39EE73B039EDA68CDA0848D1411B42E404D84401141AA44A10A7D5CDFB.jpg","tmb":"/images/6EE41C74040C8EA939DE65FDC5BAFAC937C9FFBA5579C98394E62D9BD2BC0C8D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-US7914915440_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-US7914915440_tmb.jpg"}}
