{"title":"This park is Superkilen","caption":"This park is Superkilen","desc":"The half-mile-long linear urban park called Superkilen was designed to inspire residents and visitors to congregate together in Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen's most culturally and ethnically diverse neighborhoods. What was once a public space battling gang activity, graffiti, and vandalism, is now an example of 'extreme public participation.' The people who live around Superkilen helped design it, adding cultural objects that represent their homelands—more than 60 countries.","copyright":"Aerial view of Superkilen, a park in Copenhagen, Denmark (© Oliver Förstner/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=superkilen+park+copenhagen&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200210_0800%22","date":"20200210","image":{"name":"OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-US4074449236.jpg","hd":"/images/90CEA2ECF50EC81DBE626239C8EC7B7F9A0F4FBE055EE77A0D6FA400B4FD7308.jpg","tmb":"/images/EAE09E24479EFB14C407239AD1427603432A6E1B84322ED00DD3296A5EF61E0F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-US4074449236_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SuperkilenPark_EN-US4074449236_tmb.jpg"}}
