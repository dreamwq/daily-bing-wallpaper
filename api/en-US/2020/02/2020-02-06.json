{"title":"A hint of spring","caption":"A hint of spring","desc":"Native to Western Europe, and especially popular in Great Britain, snowdrops are the bulb you'll want to plant if the cold, drab landscape of winter gets you down. These small bulbs bloom very early—sometimes as soon as January—and are commonly associated with the promise of spring. But plant enough of them, or come across a naturally occurring patch, and it can look like a light dusting of winter snow has coated the ground. Need a little hope to get you through this last stretch of winter? Look no further than the lovely snowdrop.","copyright":"A snowdrop in bloom (© Péter Hegedűs/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=galanthus+nivalis&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200206_0800%22","date":"20200206","image":{"name":"OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-US3645892670.jpg","hd":"/images/8653CC600921D7B2B0184E94F3D8E0E90E96F7EF7A7352F087090FFFFC0BF034.jpg","tmb":"/images/AE23820BADB751AC1E8B398F0927DE7E0FCDA6F9A55E0571273F12F47DBA221B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-US3645892670_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-US3645892670_tmb.jpg"}}
