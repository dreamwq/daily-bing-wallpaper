In recent weeks, the Thunderbirds have joined with the Navy's Blue Angels air squadron to conduct formation flights over several American cities as a salute to essential workers and health care personnel on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. The two services are flying over some cities together and others separately. In a press release, Air Force Lt. Col. John Caldwell, the Thunderbird commander and lead pilot, said, 'We are honored to fly over these cities in a display of national unity and support for the men and women keeping our communities safe.'","copyright":"US Air Force Thunderbirds perform over Hampton, Virginia (Â© gmeland/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=armed+forces+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200516_0700%22","date":"20200516","image":{"name":"OHR.ArmedForces_EN-US2469522869.jpg","hd":"/images/278CDA132B7BB73A687297D53EFF3B30D7F9855C0ACEDF40598CA5942B725EC1.jpg","tmb":"/images/9B5F696F4CBAC4D1E0D7DD64A677839E9E9500C7372D700CEC56F9848434DE96.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmedForces_EN-US2469522869_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmedForces_EN-US2469522869_tmb.jpg"}}
