Here in the San Basilio neighborhood of the city’s old town, the densely packed whitewashed houses look out onto courtyards and patios embellished by hanging flowerpots and trailing plants. The sculpture on today’s homepage, by artist José Manuel Belmonte, pays homage to the caretakers who pass along the tradition.","copyright":"Bronze sculpture of a child and his grandfather caring for plants and flowers in the San Basilio neighborhood of Córdoba, Spain (© David M G/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=san+basilio+cordoba&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200505_0700%22","date":"20200505","image":{"name":"OHR.CordovanCourts_EN-US4311661710.jpg","hd":"/images/3CA4BE149172E73D56AB18E18770B67848C5772693927D8E5B07898E6A09FBB9.jpg","tmb":"/images/23E0E3EF2E04D535513BA36DEE36B608090089F105D5C6029BD7672097A1A5E1.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CordovanCourts_EN-US4311661710_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CordovanCourts_EN-US4311661710_tmb.jpg"}}
