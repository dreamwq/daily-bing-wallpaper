{"title":"Here’s looking at you, teachers","caption":"Here’s looking at you, teachers","desc":"We think the wise, scholarly owl makes a fine mascot for Teacher Appreciation Week, which wraps up today in the US. The annual celebration honors educators who dedicate their lives to developing the minds of young and old, sparking curiosity and encouraging us to explore and think about the world around us. The celebration has a special significance this year, as teachers facing widespread school closures have quickly adapted their teaching methods, including the extensive implementation of remote learning. We're eternally grateful for their efforts, including the support they've given the parents who are stepping up at home.","copyright":"Barn owl sitting on a branch (© blickwinkel/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=teacher+appreciation+week&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200509_0700%22","date":"20200509","image":{"name":"OHR.BarnOwlMigration_EN-US1831112399.jpg","hd":"/images/474301052549061262445E5FB8227FF6BA7AF7A1D9C75553F90166F6B863E79C.jpg","tmb":"/images/699916D13185F3DD7AB093AAF331A57B29994E2539ED459690C4971C8E71D66A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarnOwlMigration_EN-US1831112399_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarnOwlMigration_EN-US1831112399_tmb.jpg"}}
