{"title":"Loud waters","caption":"Loud waters","desc":"Roaring Fork may seem like a misnomer for this mountain stream in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During dry spells, it's a gentle brook. But Roaring Fork descends 2,500 feet over just 2 miles—a steep drop down Mount Le Conte. When heavy rains swell the stream, Roaring Fork transforms into a whitewater rush, with the sound of the surging water echoing off the sandstone walls of the mountain.","copyright":"Roaring Fork in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (© Paul Hassell/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=roaring+fork+great+smoky+mountains&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200519_0700%22","date":"20200519","image":{"name":"OHR.RoaringFork_EN-US2762183808.jpg","hd":"/images/9E0918EBEDE444A9533C10ED57CCA18EE916B4AEF15A2C216365A7E75EACA914.jpg","tmb":"/images/0BC6D52B53ECEF9BB97D01360E7700B258DD97098CD74BEE1E654994567B6D4F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RoaringFork_EN-US2762183808_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RoaringFork_EN-US2762183808_tmb.jpg"}}
