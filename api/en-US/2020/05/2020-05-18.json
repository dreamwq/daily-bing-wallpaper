In the capital city of Doha you'll find its national museum, shown here, which opened in March 2019. This elaborate building was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel, who sourced his inspiration from the desert rose crystal. Look closely and amid the futuristic interlocking disks of the new museum you'll see the early 20th-century Old Amiri Palace, once home of the Emir of Qatar, surrounded by a courtyard of palm trees.","copyright":"National Museum of Qatar in Doha, Qatar (Â© Hasan Zaidi/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=national+museum+of+qatar&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200518_0700%22","date":"20200518","image":{"name":"OHR.QatarMuseum_EN-US2624327100.jpg","hd":"/images/B769496408BFFC2C956E14342ED6BE802F8F3C3244289962070475FD6A5C1EFB.jpg","tmb":"/images/1748EE925CF1CB23C5F1CF5B88B023027EFEBD8BBBA52786323453C0DA4C489A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QatarMuseum_EN-US2624327100_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QatarMuseum_EN-US2624327100_tmb.jpg"}}
