If you're a 'Star Wars' fan you might recognize it as the planet of Crait, featured in 'The Last Jedi.' In reality it's Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, found in southwest Bolivia. This otherworldly landscape is near the crest of the Andes, about 12,000 feet above sea level. The salt flat was formed when prehistoric lakes dried up over centuries, leaving behind a salt crust several feet deep. After a rare rainfall, a thin layer of perfectly still water will transform the salt flat into a giant mirror 80 miles across.","copyright":"Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia (Â© Ignacio Palacios/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=star+wars+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200504_0700%22","date":"20200504","image":{"name":"OHR.LastJedi_EN-US6415775481.jpg","hd":"/images/CDA437C9B8DDDDFEED97F7235A8A8D4D22CA5D5147BCF3EBBCE626367B88654E.jpg","tmb":"/images/603D79D473851E8D77048CC7E465B7D8F14D3493BA6662CD25001A74655926CF.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-US6415775481_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LastJedi_EN-US6415775481_tmb.jpg"}}
