{"title":"World Laughter Day—it's a hoot","caption":"World Laughter Day—it's a hoot","desc":"We could all use a little laughter right now, and this snowy owl seems to have the right idea. Or maybe she knows it's World Laughter Day, which has been celebrated every first Sunday in May since 1998. Started in India by Dr. Madan Kataria, founder of the worldwide laughter yoga movement, World Laughter Day aims to raise awareness about laughter and its healing benefits. It's not about watching or reading something funny—though there's nothing wrong with that—it's about improving your mood and well-being by laughing spontaneously. However you choose to do it, take inspiration from the owl and laugh today.","copyright":"Snowy owl at Jones Beach, Long Island, New York (© Vicki Jauron/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=snowy+owl+bird&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200503_0700%22","date":"20200503","image":{"name":"OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-US6301340149.jpg","hd":"/images/98A1CC5742F41C53415473467B6661D358852E35FA67E3DF64E9284D39F98C10.jpg","tmb":"/images/51E877CCA32804C27CC260FB887EC9B3A9B98BAB43ED69F98036017A735D9262.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-US6301340149_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaughingOwl_EN-US6301340149_tmb.jpg"}}
