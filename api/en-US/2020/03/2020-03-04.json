{"title":"A different kind of dive","caption":"A different kind of dive","desc":"Our homepage divers are descending the clear turquoise waters of a cenote on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. A cenote is a sinkhole that's created when limestone bedrock collapses and exposes the groundwater underneath, creating pools of fresh water that delight swimmers, and even cave divers like those on our homepage. They're diving in 'El Pit' cenote, part of a flooded cave system near Tulum. It's one of thousands of cenotes documented on the Yucatán, and a popular spot for divers who come to swim through the brilliant sunbeams.","copyright":"Divers at El Pit cenote, located in Sistema Dos Ojos, Quintana Roo, Mexico (© Christia Vizl/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=cenote&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200304_0800%22","date":"20200304","image":{"name":"OHR.ElPit_EN-US2350184760.jpg","hd":"/images/7DD806089C88798BB122BF282F60DEA1E56D9A83F083BAE33D24529D3E1C7BD3.jpg","tmb":"/images/E2292CA059ABE0C5D6D241162EEE4DA0A3A6B2B4B79AF551DD30B0DFAACA1C61.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElPit_EN-US2350184760_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElPit_EN-US2350184760_tmb.jpg"}}
