Organizers scheduled the protest on the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration to draw maximum publicity to their cause—voting rights for women. But it would be another eight years before American women would finally be guaranteed the vote. That came on August 18, 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, after a century of protest and activism.","copyright":"Women's suffragists who walked from New York City to Washington, DC, to join the National American Woman Suffrage Association parade on March 3, 1913 (© Everett Collection/age fotostock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=women%27s+history+month&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200301_0800%22","date":"20200301","image":{"name":"OHR.HikersVoters_EN-US2077085885.jpg","hd":"/images/5B0C805F27DD3395C21832A8394DF405F1FC0C7AEFEDCB1CA1CBF901EBED168B.jpg","tmb":"/images/66406BFEC51BE6386E8FF9676C91628E58F9140F7878BFC20057D687C8801E4D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HikersVoters_EN-US2077085885_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HikersVoters_EN-US2077085885_tmb.jpg"}}
