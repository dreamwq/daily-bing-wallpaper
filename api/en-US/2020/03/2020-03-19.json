{"title":"Sunburst at Angkor","caption":"Sunburst at Angkor","desc":"The spring equinox finds us at Angkor Wat, the most famous Buddhist temple in Angkor Archaeological Park. The park is essentially a 154-square-mile collection of historic temples and related holy sites just outside the city of Siem Reap, Cambodia. On the equinox, when the sun rises it aligns with the top of the main tower at Angkor Wat before climbing farther into the sky to usher in longer days and shorter nights. Of course, if this photo is any indication, every sunrise at Angkor Wat is spectacular.","copyright":"Sunrise at Angkor Wat in Cambodia (Â© Sergio Diaz/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Angkor+Wat&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200319_0700%22","date":"20200319","image":{"name":"OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-US9664645165.jpg","hd":"/images/8FB6528FE8FC8169BC70351765D2D885D500DDE07CFE2C4ED0C7F3FBFA63F43E.jpg","tmb":"/images/75CC2D40765BAFD5F9F6B869BC0182021CA698FC29E6A2E89ADC612C517211E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-US9664645165_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EquinoxAngkor_EN-US9664645165_tmb.jpg"}}
