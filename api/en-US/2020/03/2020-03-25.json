{"title":"It's Tolkien Reading Day","caption":"It's Tolkien Reading Day","desc":"For Tolkien Reading Day, we're featuring Oxford University's Radcliffe Camera, the reading room for the Bodleian Library, which is home to the world's largest archive of J.R.R. Tolkien's original manuscripts and drawings. While Tolkien never worked in the Radcliffe Camera (Latin for 'room'), he both studied at Oxford (graduating in 1915 with first-class honors in English language) and taught here as a professor.","copyright":"The Radcliffe Camera, Oxford, England, for Tolkien Reading Day (Â© Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=tolkien+reading+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200325_0700%22","date":"20200325","image":{"name":"OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-US0047487559.jpg","hd":"/images/70DDDBEC883677150C9D0C5AC368BDD1F9C4BCFA7092F0073FBE2E7A6B0F1774.jpg","tmb":"/images/8D5BE073F9284EA7F3AEF47EE7D41DB752B9971341BF0D7DC0835558787E04EE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-US0047487559_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RadcliffeCamera_EN-US0047487559_tmb.jpg"}}
