{"title":"Remembering the Arizona","caption":"Remembering the Arizona","desc":"Looking up through the seven skylights of the USS Arizona Memorial, you'll see the Stars and Stripes wave solemnly against a bright Hawaiian sky. On today's infamous date, the flag flies at half-mast to honor the 2,403 people killed in Japan's December 7, 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor that thrust the US into World War II. Of these, 1,177 service members perished in a direct hit that blew apart the munitions-laden Arizona. Over 900 of these casualties remain buried at sea within the ship's superstructure. They're joined by survivors who upon their later deaths chose to have their ashes interred alongside their fallen crewmates.","copyright":"Flag above the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii (Â© PJF Military Collection/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pearl+Harbor+Remembrance+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191207_0800%22","date":"20191207","image":{"name":"OHR.FlagAboveArizona_EN-US9636197389.jpg","hd":"/images/025304A2F2DF215DC2CFF2C83953905AA463F2F5A6EA6ABC9D1936492B73B831.jpg","tmb":"/images/549AB31E6D27753C148E2283C2C6908C64219DCD4DC6AA82FA72AF84D9D59D4D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlagAboveArizona_EN-US9636197389_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlagAboveArizona_EN-US9636197389_tmb.jpg"}}
