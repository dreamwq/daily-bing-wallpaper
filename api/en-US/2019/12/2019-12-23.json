December 23 marks Festivus, a tongue-in-cheek observance created by writer Daniel O'Keefe. At first an O'Keefe family inside joke, Festivus was rebranded as a rejection of Christmas-season commercialism and written into a 1997 episode of 'Seinfeld' by Daniel's son Dan. The show introduced such goofy new traditions as the 'Airing of Grievances,' 'Feats of Strength,' and identifying 'Festivus miracles.'","copyright":"Gentoo penguins airing grievances in Antarctica (Â© Grafissimo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gentoo+penguin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191223_0800%22","date":"20191223","image":{"name":"OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-US3147113419.jpg","hd":"/images/84DACA46DF1A1B26500ADBD0272CA90CD639D6FB68070C966405C8C184DD9D22.jpg","tmb":"/images/65CBE1209A27B37C62F9F2FF503D01B24E950A663D42C2805F952CBC62ADFA75.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-US3147113419_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AiringGrievances_EN-US3147113419_tmb.jpg"}}
