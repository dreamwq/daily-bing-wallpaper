In the 18th century, during the Qing dynasty of China, the Qianlong Emperor ordered the construction of this collection of gardens, lakes, and various structures, including temples and small palaces. These days, it's one of Beijing's premier attractions and sure to be crowded this time of year, with visitors headed to the bridge in time for sunset.","copyright":"The Seventeen-Arch Bridge over Kunming Lake, Beijing Summer Palace, China (Â© Jia Wang/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=beijing+summer+palace&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191221_0800%22","date":"20191221","image":{"name":"OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-US6457012478.jpg","hd":"/images/6A82FF0F3F717F585F3A5563D984156715811701524406EC3D9A0291A244CFB4.jpg","tmb":"/images/5B34F4A7A7EC23D80A95D261B5B7F160B8A1F560EA0E7DF91F9844762BB7BD7E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-US6457012478_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-US6457012478_tmb.jpg"}}
