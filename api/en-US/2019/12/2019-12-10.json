The room, which is completely covered in mosaic tiles, includes representations of Swedish history and culture. Swedes refer to their capital as Mälardrottningen—the Queen of Lake Mälar—and our image depicts the queen with the city of Stockholm in her lap (the city lies between the lake and the Baltic Sea).","copyright":"Golden Hall in Stockholm City Hall for today's Nobel Prize award ceremonies (© Mikhail Markovskiy/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Nobel+Prize+ceremony&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191210_0800%22","date":"20191210","image":{"name":"OHR.GoldenHall_EN-US0236867066.jpg","hd":"/images/E00829E51FBE10E022CC171FFD5B4602ED0F8AAA6295DC7B0A494CD0B8E2CB71.jpg","tmb":"/images/36CA8F2CBE9A4BBFCB4C56BFE45C2E0074365E4A96084941413CAF72852C98D2.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldenHall_EN-US0236867066_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldenHall_EN-US0236867066_tmb.jpg"}}
