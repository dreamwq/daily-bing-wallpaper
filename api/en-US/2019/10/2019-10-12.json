What makes this race so unusual—and so popular—is that it's open to both professional and amateur sailors. Its beginning was fairly inauspicious—in 1969 only 51 boats sailed in the inaugural race. But it's been drawing increasing numbers of sailors and spectators to Trieste each year. Last year, for the 50th anniversary of the Barcolana, 2,689 yachts raced the course and set the official record for largest sailing race in the world. Featuring a youth sailing race, an open-water swimming race, a night sailing race, music concerts, food and wine tastings, and many other events, the Barcolana offers opportunities for landlubbers and sea dogs alike to enjoy themselves during the regatta.","copyright":"Boats massing for the Barcolana regatta in the Gulf of Trieste, Italy (© Ababsolutum/E+/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Barcolana+Regatta&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191012_0700%22","date":"20191012","image":{"name":"OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-US0019708753.jpg","hd":"/images/084E40F4F3F0A06117A00DD74192AB9C5CBB58769B9D0DE6D4E408684F73DACC.jpg","tmb":"/images/3D5D65C6FE723E185557A436AEBEE3F23601F6F11EC2890011550687782C26E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-US0019708753_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BarcolanaTrieste_EN-US0019708753_tmb.jpg"}}
