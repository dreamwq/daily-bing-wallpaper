Flying thousands of miles across the open ocean, these dragonflies are known as globe skimmers, which refers to their migratory behavior. Until about 20 years ago, no one knew where they came from. But researchers have since discovered that the dragonflies take advantage of moving weather systems and monsoon rains to make their epic migration across the Arabian Sea from India. From the Maldives, the dragonflies will continue their journey, passing through the Seychelles and then on to East Africa.","copyright":"Close-up of a dragonfly wing (Â© Azwar Thaufeeq/500px/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=dragonflies&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191015_0700%22","date":"20191015","image":{"name":"OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-US0767811525.jpg","hd":"/images/8F8A1E228DC65DD6B1B873F4B08B0ABD48A3D1EC369FA56CEB8564E1D2A8020D.jpg","tmb":"/images/867ED7DD06348AEF646C04D7215148B6227413D4D1AC9898E54C590FA55D7A7B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-US0767811525_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-US0767811525_tmb.jpg"}}
