Since then, it's become an iconic building in the New York cityscape. Housed in a white       spiral building that emerges from Fifth Avenue, the museum started with several private collections, including that of founder Solomon R. Guggenheim. The collection has grown over the decades to contain some of the world’s most notable examples of impressionist, post-impressionist, early modern, and contemporary art.","copyright":"Solomon R.
