{"title":"Bobbing for crab apples","caption":"Bobbing for crab apples","desc":"If it's autumn, it's apple season—the time for apple pie, apple cider (and, of course, apple cider doughnuts), apple cake, caramel apples, or just biting into a fresh, crisp apple, especially one you picked yourself. There are more than 7,500 varieties of apples grown in the world—about 2,500 in the US. This blackbird is enjoying a crab apple, which most people find a little sour to eat right off the tree. They do, however, work well for jelly, apple butter, or even pie filling. The term 'crab apple' doesn’t refer to a specific species but is used for several types of small apples. In Celtic culture, crab apples are associated with love and marriage. Supposedly if you throw the seeds into a fire while saying the name of your love, the seeds explode if your love is true. We'd try it but we're busy baking a pie.","copyright":"Blackbird eating a crab apple in a garden in Wiltshire, United Kingdom (© Nick Upton/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=apple+malus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191022_0700%22","date":"20191022","image":{"name":"OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-US1844937939.jpg","hd":"/images/E270AFC7AFF48569D7699B65355ED5DCDD039B45F84C33F14FF3000BEC23DABB.jpg","tmb":"/images/7B36944E4E222F34AEB602E277E9EBDCBC75170B2E105D832FA38D47ABC84765.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-US1844937939_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabAppleBlackbird_EN-US1844937939_tmb.jpg"}}
