Hijackers seized the plane shortly after it left Newark, New Jersey, on September 11, 2001. As travelers onboard learned of the coordinated attacks in New York and Washington, DC, a group of passengers and flight crew attempted to wrest control of the plane. The aircraft crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. It was the only one of the four hijacked planes that didn’t hit its intended target.","copyright":"The Tower of Voices at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania (© Amy Cicconi/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=tower+of+voices+flight+93+memorial&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190911_0700%22","date":"20190911","image":{"name":"OHR.TowerofVoices_EN-US2297032194.jpg","hd":"/images/870F6874848667DBD4325ADA8ED6A73FF006F094B3311B48378E0A6EC3E02EC4.jpg","tmb":"/images/401A3EB16A1413B88F7C68404F8BA77C70D3AA2F7BA6D9DFC33538A7D8EF5552.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TowerofVoices_EN-US2297032194_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TowerofVoices_EN-US2297032194_tmb.jpg"}}
