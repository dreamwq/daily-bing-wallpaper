Described by some as home to the best surf break in Norway, the island village, where sheep easily outnumber villagers, boasts two surf shops to help both novices and experts prepare for the extreme conditions. And surfing isn't just a summer sport at this famous beach located inside the Arctic Circle—during winter months, surfers come here for the unique experience of surfing under the aurora borealis.","copyright":"Arctic surfing in the Lofoten Islands, Norway, for the Lofoten Masters (© Nicolás Pina/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=lofoten+islands+norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190925_0700%22","date":"20190925","image":{"name":"OHR.LofotenSurfing_EN-US2786067859.jpg","hd":"/images/5559C4957AE3CA82C19D1E75C74C3A8E00B019B7C624218FCD8EB8EE9C607001.jpg","tmb":"/images/37CF592406CA82808950FF4CD65EF7B419DA93F2D7C4D255FA922EEF5A9A5224.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenSurfing_EN-US2786067859_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenSurfing_EN-US2786067859_tmb.jpg"}}
