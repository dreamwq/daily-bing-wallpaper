But an older German name was 'Nebel-mond,' which translates as 'fog month' in English—it's the time of the year when fog is most likely to roll in. In some parts of the world the topography and local climate make fog a regular feature of the weather, especially during certain times of the year. That’s called 'fog season.' San Francisco has a fog season. Tampa, Florida, does too. Is there a fog season where you live?","copyright":"Fog shrouds the Bavarian Alps in Germany (© Anton Petrus/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=bavarian+alps&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191116_0800%22","date":"20191116","image":{"name":"OHR.Nebelmond_EN-US7317115137.jpg","hd":"/images/C826E05B894338E3F091DF099095C7C6F3F10E211145CBD0EEA84B9A068393D5.jpg","tmb":"/images/6A4C51BD04E042B80F04FEE7B7302E1E6AF291BF350E72EB18413917E0C6C2F9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Nebelmond_EN-US7317115137_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Nebelmond_EN-US7317115137_tmb.jpg"}}
