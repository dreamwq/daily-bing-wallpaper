This historic church near Le Puy-en-Velay, France, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts visitors from around the world. It was constructed in 969 by a local bishop and dedicated to the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of mountaintops. Even before the chapel was built, the site had spiritual significance, as it was home to prehistoric dolmens (stone tombs) built by the Romans to honor their god Mercury.","copyright":"Chapel St-Michel d'Aiguilhe, Le Puy-en-Velay, France (© Jaubert French Collection/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Chapel+St-Michel+d%27+Aiguilhe&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191108_0800%22","date":"20191108","image":{"name":"OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-US4421310982.jpg","hd":"/images/B09A1019AB3F28F61C297D9314491F5FC89EEF31DE62F78BE139DE1CB9C23558.jpg","tmb":"/images/D702AE86B683A1BD909473CBA2425C2047F480C7C7CFEF9B09F2A87F96870844.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-US4421310982_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChapelAiguilhe_EN-US4421310982_tmb.jpg"}}
