{"title":"Lake of the Moon, Himachal","caption":"Lake of the Moon, Himachal","desc":"The Chandra Tal, or Chandra Taal as it is sometimes called, literally translates into ‘Lake of the Moon’. Located in the beautiful Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 4300 metres, this lake is a favourite destination with hikers. Legend has it that Tibetan traders discovered this lake, where they’d set up camp to rest before continuing their journeys. Why the name? The lake is crescent-shaped, much like a half moon.","copyright":"Chandra Tal lake in the Spiti region, Himachal Pradesh (© f9photos/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=chandra+tal&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191031_1830%22","date":"20191031","image":{"name":"OHR.ChandraTal_EN-IN1946649738.jpg","hd":"/images/E27E157C5E92A5E5E64E9E9E9F262B57F69DCD8DEA8D5E07CDFEC00D5B86FE84.jpg","tmb":"/images/69EC0DFCA1BA970B8FD232330BFDC763D1C08B4942C39141E6764EF5969C8076.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChandraTal_EN-IN1946649738_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChandraTal_EN-IN1946649738_tmb.jpg"}}
