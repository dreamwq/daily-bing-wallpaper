{"title":"American Bird Count begins","caption":"American Bird Count begins","desc":"Today marks the start of the annual Christmas Bird Count, a bird census sponsored by the National Audubon Society (a US-based non-profit dedicated to conservation efforts) that also happens to be the longest-running citizen scientist survey in the world. Each year the count runs from December 14 to January 5, giving bird lovers across North America a chance to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The findings recorded by participants are collected and used to gauge the health of various bird populations. This information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas.","copyright":"Spruce grouse in a spruce tree in Denali National Park, Alaska, USA (Â© Yva Momatiuk and John Eastcott/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Spruce+grouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191213_1830%22","date":"20191213","image":{"name":"OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505.jpg","hd":"/images/B17BA7338809795EE42B91CC30A022291FD7FC5E9083FCC9354E883CC54614F7.jpg","tmb":"/images/E1BC9205DE28AE6DF46777AD3AF14012FE3F05B9ADB9CF6CE72407DC8B87A989.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGrouse_EN-IN6199483505_tmb.jpg"}}
