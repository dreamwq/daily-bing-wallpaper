The colourful history of the region has seen Key under attack by the Moghuls, the Dogras, and other armies. A fire in 1840 and an earthquake in 1975 also caused damage to this monastery, which was restored by the Archeological Survey of India.","copyright":"Key monastery at Spiti valley, Himachal Pradesh (Â© Inigo Cia/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=key+monastery+spiti&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191214_1830%22","date":"20191214","image":{"name":"OHR.SpitiMonastery_EN-IN9580014571.jpg","hd":"/images/E190EB1AECC243C7446F74EF442A4A87866E8D9083312BCEE53C06A39F1AD672.jpg","tmb":"/images/893FE28EED9902C073FA6A2690F712F0DD6F59DEAA937F4CBC50BD70E5A8CB2D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpitiMonastery_EN-IN9580014571_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpitiMonastery_EN-IN9580014571_tmb.jpg"}}
