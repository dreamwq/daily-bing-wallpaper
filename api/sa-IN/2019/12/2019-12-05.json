Home to thousands of limestone pillars said to have been born millions of years ago, it’s up for debate as to how the pinnacles were actually formed. However, most believe they are a result of seashells gradually breaking down into the sand, which was then later eroded over time by mother nature herself.","copyright":"The Pinnacles at Nambung National Park, Western Australia (© Frank Krahmer/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Nambung+Pinnacles&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191205_1830%22","date":"20191205","image":{"name":"OHR.NambungPinnacles_EN-IN0493297119.jpg","hd":"/images/2A0A02E06FFD406A81D62EA1F9BBC0F768AB9B0A36CEB0F16067394DBD9468DE.jpg","tmb":"/images/CE4DF1E281607B4134A9367A366D9B1205403CCDCBE478DA398E86164830D756.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NambungPinnacles_EN-IN0493297119_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NambungPinnacles_EN-IN0493297119_tmb.jpg"}}
