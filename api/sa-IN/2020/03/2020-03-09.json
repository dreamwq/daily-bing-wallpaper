{"title":"Playing Holi, anyone?","caption":"Playing Holi, anyone?","desc":"Doljatra is a festival of colours celebrated on the same day as Holi, but limited to the West Bengal and Bangladesh region. Similar in celebratory style, the festival revolves around a different story to Holi – it is believed to be the day that Lord Krishna confessed his love for Goddess Radha. Holi of course, as we know – speaks of the successful return of Ram from Lanka – a victory of good over evil.  Doljatra has added importance in the Bengal region – it marks the birth anniversary of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a poet regarded by some as an incarnation of Lord Krishna.","copyright":"Brightly-coloured powder for sale during Holi season (© Max Bauerfeind/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=doljatra+festival&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200309_1830%22","date":"20200309","image":{"name":"OHR.DoljatraPowder_EN-IN1157372123.jpg","hd":"/images/B60587A3FB00D67536EA0EEEA351136CAAD8C10FAAEC5D18722BBBCEBDBE2F54.jpg","tmb":"/images/60F74F6AAFA751BB461A1937B19D3DA7B2682E2C3A649DD69389BA88E8664C7A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DoljatraPowder_EN-IN1157372123_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DoljatraPowder_EN-IN1157372123_tmb.jpg"}}
