{"title":"Stained-glass windows at VT station, Mumbai","caption":"Stained-glass windows at VT station, Mumbai","desc":"The stained-glass window that you see on today’s homepage is from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, in Mumbai, earlier known as the Victoria Terminus. ‘VT’ as it is still commonly called by Mumbaiites, was modelled after London’s St. Pancras station. The terminus was opened to public in 1882, designed in its gothic style by FW Stevens for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.  Stone friezes, flying buttresses and these stained-glass windows are iconic elements of the design. Next time your’e at VT, don’t forget to look up – some of these design elements are so high up, they can only be seen from the eye level of the upper deck of a double decker bus.","copyright":"Colourful stained-glass window at the CST railway station (earlier Victoria Terminus), Mumbai (© Natalie Solveland/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=victoria+terminus+mumbai&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200117_1830%22","date":"20200117","image":{"name":"OHR.WindowVT_EN-IN7393118797.jpg","hd":"/images/75B30E8624B4BD8238D8D37A482BBB522D69A37BF3E480855B92055313E106C9.jpg","tmb":"/images/D6717EEACFA3BB34621320C1CB4721FBB8ACA4393DEACE18FE9767D72149E1BA.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WindowVT_EN-IN7393118797_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WindowVT_EN-IN7393118797_tmb.jpg"}}
