Their construction was a monumental effort, with materials hauled up in pieces by around 50 workers under the direction of a Lampang monk over the course of two years. The resulting temple complex of Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn is off the beaten path—visitors need to drive more than 2 hours from Chiangmai, then make a 800-metre stair climb in what can be punishing heat. But the views from the top seem worth the effort.","copyright":"Floating temples of Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn in Lampang province, Thailand (© pa_YON/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=lampang+province+thailand&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200412_1830%22","date":"20200412","image":{"name":"OHR.WatChaloem_EN-IN0520768366.jpg","hd":"/images/329D149B252324BED1EE49CAC40C4C79556FB2FBD920713CD309468F82F033EF.jpg","tmb":"/images/68AD9CBE4407B8ABF99F3693AA02455A4E7DE79895338864058F057FACF63274.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WatChaloem_EN-IN0520768366_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WatChaloem_EN-IN0520768366_tmb.jpg"}}
