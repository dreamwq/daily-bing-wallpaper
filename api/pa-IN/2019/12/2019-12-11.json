{"title":"On the lookout for Sheep-Cote Clod","caption":"On the lookout for Sheep-Cote Clod","desc":"You're looking at one of the oldest breeds of sheep in the world. Icelandic sheep descended from short-tailed sheep brought  to the island from Norway in the 9th and 10th century with the first wave of settlers. These sheep, with their dual-layer wooly coats, thrive in this harsh environment, outnumbering people in Iceland by more than a factor of two. But on December 12, these sheep, especially the ewes, will have to contend with something more invasive than the wind chill factor. Sheep-Cote Clod, the first of the 13 Yule Lads, is due to visit. Who's that? Well, Christmas folklore in Iceland is a little different from other places in the world, were one Santa visits children. In Iceland, it is 13 ‘Yule Lads’, mythical mountain-dwelling beings who take up the responsibility of various Christmas duties.","copyright":"Icelandic sheep for the first night of the Yule Lads (© John Porter LRPS/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=icelandic+sheep&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191211_1830%22","date":"20191211","image":{"name":"OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-IN1114012507.jpg","hd":"/images/ABEFDEAF1EC1251EE0DF15F2C4FB03FEBB5A3731E01BA26045896DCDD4B7260C.jpg","tmb":"/images/3E43FBEF3F462D0099152A71BFF8F29799F33D71AE0195513A0AD6650F79EB16.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-IN1114012507_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCoteClod_EN-IN1114012507_tmb.jpg"}}
