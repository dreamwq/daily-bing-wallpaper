{"title":"Ready, Set, Snow","caption":"Ready, Set, Snow","desc":"Far above the clouds, an adrenaline-seeking skier glides past the jagged Crater Rock on Oregon's Mount Hood (western USA). He's practicing a relatively young sport known as speed riding—similar to paragliding but with more emphasis on high velocity than altitude. Skiers with parachute-like 'wings' launch downslope at high speed, navigating runs partly on skis and partly in the air.","copyright":"Backcountry adventurer Alex Peterson speed riding on the south side of Mount Hood, Oregon, USA (© Richard Hallman/DEEPOL by plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=skiing&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200118_1830%22","date":"20200118","image":{"name":"OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-IN4765233283.jpg","hd":"/images/271B72E8E1EB790B1A87E9B251E911F857E328251AAAD26763D3CA2210683B8A.jpg","tmb":"/images/386BFFF574C2FFC4B474DD509208A83FBC5F30F472A160D6CBBF38F4B58D8E87.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-IN4765233283_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpeedFlying_EN-IN4765233283_tmb.jpg"}}
