{"title":"Celebrating 200 years of statehood","caption":"Celebrating 200 years of statehood","desc":"We're wandering out onto the striated coastal rocks of Maine's Pemaquid Point at sunrise to mark 200 years since Maine became the 23rd US state. With roughly 5,000 miles of jagged, rocky coastline, Maine is studded with dozens of lighthouses, and the light at Pemaquid Point is one of the most celebrated—and historic. First, that history - the lighthouse was commissioned in 1827, but it needed to be rebuilt in 1835 after the original began falling apart. (Note: Don't use saltwater when mixing your mortar.) Maine residents chose the Pemaquid Point Light for display on their state's coin as part of the US 50 State Quarters Program.","copyright":"Pemaquid Point Light in the Damariscotta region of Maine, USA (©  (© Tom Whitney/Adobe Stock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=pemaquid+point+lighthouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200314_1830%22","date":"20200314","image":{"name":"OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-IN9459562207.jpg","hd":"/images/88DFC86BF8641B3AA35CD1D6B7001B5EC1190424A2C525BEF0E0ACFF3DC2B5EA.jpg","tmb":"/images/BB09EDD8D179FF1A85268C7942D4FF0C6BD1DE8101FCB8DA67C30AE7394AD07E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-IN9459562207_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MetamorphicRocks_EN-IN9459562207_tmb.jpg"}}
