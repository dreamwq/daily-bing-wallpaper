Today, we’re appreciating these delicate beauties in British Columbia for the annual Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. However, given the safety measures linked to COVID-19, this year, the festival can be experienced online through a virtual tree walk, Haiku workshop and a blossom photo watch. Among the 40,000 cherry blossom trees bursting with pink and white blooms, there are at least 54 different varieties in Vancouver alone. Known as Sakura, these flowers are sacred and symbolic in Japanese culture and is widely celebrated as an expression of life, death and rebirth.","copyright":"Cherry Blossom trees in Vancouver (© Bun Lee/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=vancouver+cherry+blossom+festival&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200406_0400%22","date":"20200406","image":{"name":"OHR.VanCherryBlossom_EN-CA0094032605.jpg","hd":"/images/890D71B5668B39EF975449A3E62A04F73EF7DF679F1222662594BFDA7A9755D9.jpg","tmb":"/images/C91921B4B5FE16621C7106B6CBAD96E762C346289C62CF259E8D718CD621EFB0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VanCherryBlossom_EN-CA0094032605_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VanCherryBlossom_EN-CA0094032605_tmb.jpg"}}
