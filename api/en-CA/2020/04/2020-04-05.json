That’s due to its small size, friendly face, and low-maintenance lifestyle. Perched among the petals of a purple water lily, this treefrog is a common backyard animal in parts of the U.S. and was named the official state reptile of both Louisiana and Georgia. It’s not bad for a petite treefrog who likes flowers.","copyright":"Green tree frog and purple water lily, Lake Kissimmee, Florida (© Joanne Williams/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Green+tree+frog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200405_0400%22","date":"20200405","image":{"name":"OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-CA8346982922.jpg","hd":"/images/3211C9B485019AE2C8007989A59D87447C10A1A4B30E497EC136722A24568998.jpg","tmb":"/images/08F9035776C0EED3169142FE69F8133DCD5A3A7735C4187E6D68ABF67D9CF0E8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-CA8346982922_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-CA8346982922_tmb.jpg"}}
