{"title":"Step into the dark","caption":"Step into the dark","desc":"The Isle of Skye is one of several parts of Scotland that are set aside as Dark Sky parks, where the lack of artificial light makes stargazing a spectacular event, with or without a telescope. First observed in 2003, International Dark Sky Week was the brainchild of then-high school student Jennifer Barlow. Her goal was to bring awareness of the impact of light pollution on people and the environment. Her efforts have made it a worldwide event and a centrepiece of Global Astronomy Month.","copyright":"Milky Way over Neist Point Lighthouse, Isle of Skye, Scotland (Â© Shaiith/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=dark+sky+week&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200419_0400%22","date":"20200419","image":{"name":"OHR.NeistPoint_EN-CA8880130145.jpg","hd":"/images/B2731D140396E1CD7C2133399B1F1676604CEEE8B8ACB6027EB9C1930E7AB26E.jpg","tmb":"/images/21FD696956EEA5895BE4703394E351A48A92CF3B88677ADC62F1DA3B676DEA88.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NeistPoint_EN-CA8880130145_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NeistPoint_EN-CA8880130145_tmb.jpg"}}
