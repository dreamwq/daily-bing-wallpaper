The massive church's first foundation stones were laid here in Salisbury—then called New Sarum—on April 28, 1220. The structure itself dates back even further, the bulk of it having been moved over a mile piece by piece from the former Roman stronghold of Old Sarum.","copyright":"Salisbury Cathedral with grazing flock of sheep, England (© Slawek Staszczuk Photo/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=salisbury+cathedral&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200428_0400%22","date":"20200428","image":{"name":"OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-CA7746568576.jpg","hd":"/images/FE3B9A08B7F9DE8BEDFE98ADDFA72D7ED1EE3836BB9D982FCBE0DBA5E076632D.jpg","tmb":"/images/F60AC7DDB90BB82FACF4CDE65AB28A7CB896F4AC2D0E700970E212EBD1F5E5ED.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-CA7746568576_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-CA7746568576_tmb.jpg"}}
