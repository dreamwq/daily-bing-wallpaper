{"title":"Art and soul","caption":"Art and soul","desc":"Art can seem like a portal to another dimension, as Irish-born artist Laura Buckley shows us in today's mind-bending image. She's posing here (and there, and there, and there…) with her mixed-media sculpture 'Fata Morgana' at London's Saatchi Gallery last year. The work is outwardly unassuming, made from a hexagonal wood-frame tube lined on the inside with reflective acrylic and capped on one end with a projection screen. When a viewer steps inside, the mirrored surfaces reflect their image along with a video projected on the screen, merging the two into a mind-bending mirage.","copyright":"Artist Laura Buckley with her video installation 'Fata Morgana,' Saatchi Gallery, London (© Stephen Chung/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=world+art+day+international+association+of+art&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200415_0400%22","date":"20200415","image":{"name":"OHR.FataMorgana_EN-CA8290611308.jpg","hd":"/images/F760A3A9D9AC75384FBC5693B158852FD898B9E7AE731AD633C2017031828A88.jpg","tmb":"/images/FDD19D66ACF05FD52B6E0FCFAD0CFC33F6FB7F3F95F187EB2851983CE71743BF.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FataMorgana_EN-CA8290611308_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FataMorgana_EN-CA8290611308_tmb.jpg"}}
