{"title":"Did they forget to fly south?","caption":"Did they forget to fly south?","desc":"Native to North America, trumpeter swans live near rivers, lakes, and coastal byways in Canada and northern and western U.S. states. Depending on where they live, these swans are either resident birds or medium-range migratory birds. What they all require, though, is open water during winter, since their diet consists almost entirely of aquatic plants. That may be why the swans in this image are drawn to the waters of Kelly Warm Springs in Wyoming, which won't freeze even as snow lines the banks.","copyright":"Trumpeter swans at Kelly Warm Springs, near Kelly, Wyoming (Â© DEEPOL by plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=trumpeter+swans&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200113_0500%22","date":"20200113","image":{"name":"OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-CA9019945407.jpg","hd":"/images/FC489B2FCF9D876FCE8F055873A7DC63DFE09CAC8B5EC736C4A2634B836ED447.jpg","tmb":"/images/BE4CA40538202E56BB5A3C0BEEF76541903226C98D7B84B127BB1DED2195655F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-CA9019945407_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-CA9019945407_tmb.jpg"}}
