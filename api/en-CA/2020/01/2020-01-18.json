{"title":"Frozen waterfalls and icy caves","caption":"Frozen waterfalls and icy caves","desc":"With a depth of at least 50 metres, the Maligne Canyon is the deepest canyon in the Rockies. This time of year is ideal to experience the natural beauty of winter in all its glory. With frozen waterfalls and natural ice sculptures all around, visitors here in Jasper National Park are truly treated to a winter wonderland. If you want to get up-close to the sparkling ice caves and the frozen waterfalls, the Maligne Canyon ice walk makes for a picturesque journey. However, given the uneven ice floor and risk of falling ice, a guided tour is highly recommended.","copyright":"Majestic view of a frozen waterfall at Maligne Canyon, Jasper, Alta.
