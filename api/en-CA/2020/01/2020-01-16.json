{"title":"In the valley of the doll","caption":"In the valley of the doll","desc":"Today we're featuring a picture-postcard view of Val Gardena, a valley nestled in Dolomites in the South Tyrol region of Italy. This time of year, the remote area may be a bit busier than usual as skiers are drawn to its famous slopes. In summer, it's known for other outdoor activities, such as rock climbing and hiking. Since the 17th century, the villagers have been famed for their woodcarving. Artisans create everything from simple, utilitarian items, like wood bowls, to finely detailed figurines.","copyright":"Sunset in Val Gardena in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, Italy (Â© Marco Capellari/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Val+Gardena&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200116_0500%22","date":"20200116","image":{"name":"OHR.ValGardena_EN-CA6042231152.jpg","hd":"/images/2CDA9346A673FDABDCD313F45606B9BB4651B50B6F9BBF3CF592EBF5EF4706F7.jpg","tmb":"/images/6ACCE8E73849E214C437CD6049E4FCB5001FD1BA07D0F9CA657F810AF6CDCFDC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValGardena_EN-CA6042231152_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValGardena_EN-CA6042231152_tmb.jpg"}}
