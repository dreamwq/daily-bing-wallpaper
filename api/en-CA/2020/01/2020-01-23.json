{"title":"Across the great plains of Africa","caption":"Across the great plains of Africa","desc":"This time of year, from late January to early March, babies arrive on the Serengeti. At the height of the wildebeest calving season, thousands of calves are born every day. Moments after birth, these youngsters can walk, and in just a few days, they'll be able to run fast enough to keep up with the herd. That's a good thing. Calving season isn't just a draw for safari tourists wanting a front row seat at the start of the circle of life, but also for predators like lions, cheetahs, and hyenas on the hunt for easy prey.","copyright":"Zebras and wildebeests in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (Â© Raffi Maghdessian/Cavan Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Serengeti+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200123_0500%22","date":"20200123","image":{"name":"OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-CA7381708322.jpg","hd":"/images/DA0B6DFAA272DA9D050CB308D1701C00588DC420A0882FA99B62AC0A8DB262E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/A38E318DEE8587E9C1B908644903ADA62BB4CAA43610118CE8FD0D1975D77179.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-CA7381708322_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-CA7381708322_tmb.jpg"}}
