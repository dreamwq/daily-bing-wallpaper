{"title":"Carnival comes to Olinda","caption":"Carnival comes to Olinda","desc":"It's the first official day of Carnival in Olinda and the streets in the historic part of town will be alive with revellers who come out to see dozens of giant papier-mâché puppets parade through the town. The larger-than-life 'bonecos' kick off the festivities each year and have been part of the celebrations here for over a century. They can be up to six metres tall and weigh around 45 pounds each. But Carnival in Olinda is not only about these incredible puppets. Like other Carnival celebrations in Brazil, Olinda's features music, dancing, costumes, and fun.","copyright":"Giant puppets for Carnival in Olinda, Brazil (© Pulsar Imagens/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=olinda+brazil+carnival&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200221_0500%22","date":"20200221","image":{"name":"OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-CA7783692763.jpg","hd":"/images/01395E39EE73B039EDA68CDA0848D1411B42E404D84401141AA44A10A7D5CDFB.jpg","tmb":"/images/6EE41C74040C8EA939DE65FDC5BAFAC937C9FFBA5579C98394E62D9BD2BC0C8D.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-CA7783692763_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-CA7783692763_tmb.jpg"}}
