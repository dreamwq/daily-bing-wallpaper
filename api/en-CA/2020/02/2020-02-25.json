{"title":"Jazzed for Mardi Gras","caption":"Jazzed for Mardi Gras","desc":"To celebrate New Orleans' enduring legacy of music, we're in the Tremé neighbourhood for Fat Tuesday. As Carnival season culminates today with Mardi Gras celebrations throughout the city, this historically black neighbourhood adjacent to the French Quarter will come alive with the music of jazz bands like the one depicted here. The sculptural profile of a traditional marching brass band marks one entrance to Louis Armstrong Park, a community space honouring New Orleans' musical roots with a 3.6-metre statue of its jazz legend namesake, as well as other art pieces depicting iconic NOLA musicians.","copyright":"The Roots of Music Cultural Sculpture Garden in Louis Armstrong Park, New Orleans, LA (© jejim120/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mardi+gras&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200225_0500%22","date":"20200225","image":{"name":"OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-CA8256767727.jpg","hd":"/images/1D4EA9183BB36F185182510518E68DA63EEF85EC414927DD4B12C914AFFE4AD4.jpg","tmb":"/images/0A8E17E0E8158BA0DAD6148CA573E77AD393F22F3C6B8249B100CDD1B52A696C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-CA8256767727_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-CA8256767727_tmb.jpg"}}
