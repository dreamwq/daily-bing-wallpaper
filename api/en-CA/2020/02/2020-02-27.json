Though polar bears aren’t endangered—their current conservation status is ‘vulnerable’—these magnificent beasts have become a sort of mascot for the race to slow the melting of Arctic sea ice. The Arctic ice is crucial to the bear's survival, as they hunt the ringed seals that bob up through holes in the ice. As Arctic ice decreases, the polar bear's hunting ground does too.","copyright":"A polar bear sow and her cubs in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (© Steven Kazlowski/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=polar+bear+animal&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200227_0500%22","date":"20200227","image":{"name":"OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-CA8842073130.jpg","hd":"/images/9091EB7FC79E8AF667C18284F986F93A4A7D48001BAADE6C474D012116E29E43.jpg","tmb":"/images/C1BAF195B5C798146D39EEBBB6F81AC85654574FCFD69ABD08A2F2E183B2FDF9.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-CA8842073130_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PBWhaleBones_EN-CA8842073130_tmb.jpg"}}
