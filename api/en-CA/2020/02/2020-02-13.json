{"title":"Midwinter freeze","caption":"Midwinter freeze","desc":"Abiqua Falls in Oregon is a beautiful example of a basalt column amphitheater. Over 90 per cent of all volcanic rock is basalt, but only a small fraction of it forms into the hexagonal columns that you see here. When molten lava hits the atmosphere, the rapid cooling of the rock causes it to contract into these characteristic columns. It's just part of what makes Abiqua Falls so spectacular.","copyright":"Frozen colosseum of ice sticking to the columnar basalt walls surrounding Abiqua Falls, Oregon (Â© Joshua Meador/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=abiqua+falls+oregon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200213_0500%22","date":"20200213","image":{"name":"OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-CA0019904666.jpg","hd":"/images/4E073C35BDD2FB2F24D94E1F3883BFA0B6679184C3C37396C9689FD9640E933F.jpg","tmb":"/images/1589101225C96CFC30678E01A0C1121B60342BC961F902B48B5B1039D668D4BC.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-CA0019904666_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbiquaFalls_EN-CA0019904666_tmb.jpg"}}
