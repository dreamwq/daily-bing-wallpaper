{"title":"Serenity in nature","caption":"Serenity in nature","desc":"Established since 1922, Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site that sits about 48 kilometres southwest of Banff and is only accessible via backcountry hiking trails or by a helicopter. This gem in the wilderness boasts snow-peaked mountains, glistening lakes, glaciers and luscious larch trees. Given its relative inaccessibility, it tends to draw serious campers, hikers and mountain climbers. With naturally stunning vistas and the pyramid-like appearance, the mountain is also referred to as the \"Matterhorn of the Canadian Rockies.\"","copyright":"Aerial view of Spray Lakes Reservoir, Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, Alta.
