So, we're giving you a great reason to get your nap on—it's National Napping Day. This sleep-inducing day was created by Boston University professor William Anthony in 1999 and always occurs the Monday after springing forward. The idea is that losing even just an hour of sleep renders most of us in need of some extra shut-eye. If that describes you, then maybe it's time to give napping a try.","copyright":"Grizzly bear cub relaxing, Cook Inlet, Chinitna Bay, Lake Clark National Park, Alaska (© Erlend Krumsvik/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=national+napping+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200309_0400%22","date":"20200309","image":{"name":"OHR.SnoozyTheBear_EN-CA9859093481.jpg","hd":"/images/C9B542458FAC322C02CE477F0DC600F6C29A90EE5EF8B65328C314F57848637C.jpg","tmb":"/images/5ADA2434CB0D61A42B6AA3FE5DAFD8C4461F43BE9B38772565872F05566E6615.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnoozyTheBear_EN-CA9859093481_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnoozyTheBear_EN-CA9859093481_tmb.jpg"}}
