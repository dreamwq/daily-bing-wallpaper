The Soviet cosmonaut achieved the first-ever extravehicular activity (EVA—but you and I just call it a spacewalk). He spent about 20 minutes outside the orbiting Voskhod 2 capsule. It was the ultimate risk: no one knew just what could happen to a human body in the vacuum of space. Near heatstroke, drenched with sweat, and with his suit dangerously inflating, Leonov barely made it back inside the airlock.","copyright":"NASA astronaut works on International Space Station during a spacewalk in 2006 (© NASA)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=extravehicular+activity+spacewalk&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200318_0400%22","date":"20200318","image":{"name":"OHR.RobertCurbeam_EN-CA2356179202.jpg","hd":"/images/805E11AE65E7DBEFB172D0202AE74ED50A0A3060ED23C87959B48BA3D05EFA00.jpg","tmb":"/images/C62AD5C5BEECEEF29991882880BFFD6EC3434B32A48CC2BE74B5A859D7DF22AE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RobertCurbeam_EN-CA2356179202_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RobertCurbeam_EN-CA2356179202_tmb.jpg"}}
