{"title":"Migration in progress","caption":"Migration in progress","desc":"In late winter and early spring, thousands of grey whales, many with calves in tow, swim by coastal waters of B.C. as they migrate from the warm waters of Baja California to their summer feeding grounds in the north. Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire roundtrip route clocks in at about 19,000 kilometres, making grey whales among the longest migrators of animal kingdom. Because they travel close to Vancouver’s coastline, it's also one of the few whale migrations that can be seen from shore.","copyright":"Aerial shot of grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) at the surface among bull kelp in Vancouver (© Bertie Gregory/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Eschrichtius+robustus&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200326_0400%22","date":"20200326","image":{"name":"OHR.WhaleVancouver_EN-CA6030441268.jpg","hd":"/images/EA76DD14538DF4E9A2A9054C74E8C5FECF860CD241B844AB40C3145BAAA8A847.jpg","tmb":"/images/EEC96C6369B0E00CD19A448247C23458164DCD9899BFE3640FC8462150CA1DE3.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhaleVancouver_EN-CA6030441268_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhaleVancouver_EN-CA6030441268_tmb.jpg"}}
