{"title":"Where dinosaurs once roamed","caption":"Where dinosaurs once roamed","desc":"Today we’re in Drumheller, Alberta marvelling at these exotic rock formations. The hoodoo rocks pictured here, are a result of millions of years’ worth of erosion caused by a combination of water, wind and frost. They typically stand at least five metres tall and are sculpted in layers of sandstone and shale. The top of these rocks have a harder rock (capstone) which protects the units below. If the capstone is removed, the Hoodoo rocks can disintegrate and erode completely.","copyright":"Milky-way over hoodoo rock formations in the Canadian badlands, Drumheller, Alta.
