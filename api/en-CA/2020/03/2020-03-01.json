{"title":"Tapping for sap","caption":"Tapping for sap","desc":"When springtime is around the corner, it’s time to go tapping for sap. Maple trees convert stored starch into sugars which when tapped, causes sap to flow. In our picture today, sap is likely dripping from the spout into the buckets attached to the trees. The amount of sap required to produce maple syrup is dependent on the sugar content of the sap. With a high sugar content, less sap is needed for syrup and vice versa. Once the sap is collected, it is kept cool and processed immediately to produce the highest quality of sweet maple syrup.","copyright":"Sap buckets hanging on maple trees in a forest, Quebec (© Benoit Daoust/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=maple+syrup+sap&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200301_0500%22","date":"20200301","image":{"name":"OHR.MapleSap_EN-CA4469752922.jpg","hd":"/images/836E9DA910B7A6D158CA67533E28D349DA0B5E0842AB7D886A5A3F26EB159F50.jpg","tmb":"/images/51F8BDC744B5970079EAA21F8E54EE89740A9271859881E9E16456854AAF2FD8.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MapleSap_EN-CA4469752922_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MapleSap_EN-CA4469752922_tmb.jpg"}}
