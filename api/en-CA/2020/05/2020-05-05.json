{"title":"A proud sentinel","caption":"A proud sentinel","desc":"The town of Rose Blanche is home to Newfoundland and Labrador’s iconic granite lighthouse. It was originally built in 1871 and has had a history of six keepers over its 70 years of existence. The lighthouse fell into ruins when it was abandoned, however, its spiral stone staircase kept the tower from collapsing. The site went through restoration and in 2002, it was designated a Registered Heritage Structure for its aesthetic and cultural value.","copyright":"An old lighthouse under the starry sky in Rose Blanche, Nfld.
