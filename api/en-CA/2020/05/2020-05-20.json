{"title":"A burst of green","caption":"A burst of green","desc":"If you have cabin fever, hopefully this image can virtually transport your senses to the lush Nile Creek Trail in British Columbia. Approximately five kilometres long, the trail is rated moderate and is used primarily for walking, hiking and biking. Along the way is a forest rich with various trees bursting with different shades of green. Given the damp weather, it is easy for moss to flourish on trees such as the ones pictured here.","copyright":"Moss-covered trees and ferns in a rainforest along Nile Creek, near Campbell River, B.C.
