{"title":"Spring blooms","caption":"Spring blooms","desc":"As one of the first plants to produce a flower in the Arctic, the Purple Saxifrage is a welcomed sight in the north. It is native to high mountainous regions and is the official flower of Nunavut. The plant tends to flourish in rocky areas as a dense mat on the ground. The purple flowers are supported by short stalks and aside from providing a visual treat, they also serve as herbal remedies.","copyright":"Purple Saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia) in bloom Bathurst Island, Nunavut (Â© Gerrtt Vyn/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Saxifraga+oppositifolia&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200501_0400%22","date":"20200501","image":{"name":"OHR.NunavutSaxifrage_EN-CA9160802055.jpg","hd":"/images/3FEB064AA2B5D5EF91BA8BDE90D48C91E74BA86E33FC5A5651EB9E0DE7877B40.jpg","tmb":"/images/364BFF91BF7C33A75B5110B7F15E755D9DF735330BD11EF27D28477AFBDEF79E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NunavutSaxifrage_EN-CA9160802055_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NunavutSaxifrage_EN-CA9160802055_tmb.jpg"}}
