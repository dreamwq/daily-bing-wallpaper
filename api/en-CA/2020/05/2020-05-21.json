Today, Jeff Hanson is a successful visually impaired artist who only vaguely sees shapes and colours. Although legally blind, he's developed a unique tactile process that helps him feel his compositions by first plastering the canvas with a thick plastic goop. Once that hardens, he uses the plastic ridges to navigate a piece, lending the composition form so he can add his signature vibrant colour. He playfully calls each painting 'a sight for sore eyes,' selling his art to appreciators like Warren Buffett, Elton John, and other collectors. Yet, one of the most creative aspects of Hanson's life is the way he's had to develop assistive methods to paint.","copyright":"'Strolling the Biltmore,' a painting by Jeff Hanson (Â© Jeff Hanson Art)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=global+accessibility+awareness+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200521_0400%22","date":"20200521","image":{"name":"OHR.JeffHanson_EN-CA5170091772.jpg","hd":"/images/E11C148A07B57972CDE019C74D22C8B3550DEB5666ABCCF8FB8525700312F3A9.jpg","tmb":"/images/5F951BC3FFDF7FF56BB3724EC9317D02AC258EB73FD1CF05C66FC4D5F6E6550A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffHanson_EN-CA5170091772_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffHanson_EN-CA5170091772_tmb.jpg"}}
