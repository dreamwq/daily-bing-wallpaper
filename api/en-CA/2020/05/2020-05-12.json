May 12, 2020 is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the 'Lady with the Lamp' credited with reinventing and modernizing the profession of nursing. Born into a wealthy English family living in Italy, she spurned the traditional Victorian role of wife and hostess to embark on a career in nursing and social reform. After training as a nurse in Germany and serving as one in London, her friend and confidant, War Secretary Sidney Herbert, sent Nightingale and a staff of 38 women she had trained as nurses to help care for the wounded of the Crimean War.","copyright":"Painted and leaded glass window panel on display at the Florence Nightingale Museum, London, U.K. (© David Gee/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=international+nurses+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200512_0400%22","date":"20200512","image":{"name":"OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-CA9376896221.jpg","hd":"/images/8EC4903F41A8393715C6287FFB1E84B8203B4DADFB772455B7430A01A6100158.jpg","tmb":"/images/893107F701D13A96FDC57861AEFF189DAA59D9DCEE6D62E9DD4DDB9909B76C37.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-CA9376896221_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceNightingale_EN-CA9376896221_tmb.jpg"}}
