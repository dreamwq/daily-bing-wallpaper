While the colourful event celebrates these delicate flowers, it also symbolizes the international friendship between Canada and Netherlands. About 100,000 tulip bulbs were originally gifted as a symbol of gratitude to Canada for the protection of the Royal Dutch Family during World War II. Our homepage today features the ‘Maple Leaf’ tulips which were bred to observe the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017.","copyright":"‘Maple Leaf’ tulips In a garden in Ottawa (© Bao Le Dinh Quoc/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=canadian+tulip+festival&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200516_0400%22","date":"20200516","image":{"name":"OHR.MapleLeafTulips_EN-CA5696682407.jpg","hd":"/images/F5D3814E002E4E47D584BE203F9EEF2A706D96F2BD0F26530EA44381BC1039CE.jpg","tmb":"/images/B90939EAC95EE6D78C76B18CE0075A07D9B350BD0B5EADA6D4D2F212D3B03B19.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MapleLeafTulips_EN-CA5696682407_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MapleLeafTulips_EN-CA5696682407_tmb.jpg"}}
