{"title":"3, 2, 1 … Happy New Year!","caption":"3, 2, 1 … Happy New Year!","desc":"Backnang, the city celebrating the new year in this photo, is in Germany's Baden region. Thanks to the Rhine River on the west, and the Black Forest to the east, the soil in Baden is ideal for vineyards. Among the varieties of wine produced here, Spätburgunder is common, which you may know by its more common French name: Pinot Noir. It seems likely that the people of Backnang would be celebrating with a glass of Pinot or something else this evening. However you choose to celebrate, here's wishing you a very happy and healthy new year!","copyright":"Fireworks for New Year's Eve in Backnang, Germany (© Lilly/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=backnang%2c+germany&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191231_0500%22","date":"20191231","image":{"name":"OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-CA7624132165.jpg","hd":"/images/75D13FA36B8C55B594C457062106AA59269794464A900390AED31CC07F1C36B5.jpg","tmb":"/images/9429EF86E7D5F5EB247A5882DEBF9340AE5A210257631A915BA35617FD81DAD0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-CA7624132165_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-CA7624132165_tmb.jpg"}}
