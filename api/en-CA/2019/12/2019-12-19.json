{"title":"Bearberry and lichens","caption":"Bearberry and lichens","desc":"Native to Asia, Europe and North America, the bearberry plant is studded with dark green leaves with edible, glossy berries. Despite the variations in elevation and climate, they can be found widespread across all the provinces and territories, here in Canada. Given the bright red colour of the berries and the pop of green from the leaves, this plant doubles as an attractive festive décor this time of the year. While arctostaphylos uva-ursi is the botanical name for bearberry, it is also commonly known as kinnikinnick, sandberry and mealberry.","copyright":"Bearberry (arctostaphylos) and lichens, Nunavik, Que.
