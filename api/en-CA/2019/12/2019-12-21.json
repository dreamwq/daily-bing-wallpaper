In the 18th century, during the reign of the Qing dynasty of China, Emperor Qinglong ordered the construction of this 2.8 square kilometre collection of gardens, lakes, and various structures including temples and small palaces. Today it's one of Beijing's premier attractions and will be crowded today with visitors headed to the bridge in time for sunset.","copyright":"The Seventeen-Arch Bridge over Kunming Lake in Beijing Summer Palace, China (Â© Jia Wang/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=beijing+summer+palace&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191221_0500%22","date":"20191221","image":{"name":"OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-CA6652948362.jpg","hd":"/images/6A82FF0F3F717F585F3A5563D984156715811701524406EC3D9A0291A244CFB4.jpg","tmb":"/images/5B34F4A7A7EC23D80A95D261B5B7F160B8A1F560EA0E7DF91F9844762BB7BD7E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-CA6652948362_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeventeenSolstice_EN-CA6652948362_tmb.jpg"}}
