On the morning of December 16, 1944, the beleaguered German army threw its best remaining troops and armour against a lightly defended section of the American and Allied line. Bad weather neutralized Allied air superiority and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a 'bulge' in its offensive west into Belgium. Desperate to hold the line, U.S. General Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to hold the strategically important crossroads in Bastogne.","copyright":"Luzulo-Fagetum beech forest covered with frost and snow, Ardennes, Belgium (Â© Philippe Moes/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=battle+of+the+bulge&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191215_0500%22","date":"20191215","image":{"name":"OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-CA0134099144.jpg","hd":"/images/1FF984B867106DE51A90FE503A0D08964B90B8496427EC84839514FC636CF71A.jpg","tmb":"/images/98EB033D0AAC144875F9EAE97426353E1D57B4A0990DB02D1D17B8C36DBFBD0B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-CA0134099144_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutsWeekend_EN-CA0134099144_tmb.jpg"}}
