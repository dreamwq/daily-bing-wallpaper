This year marks the 22nd edition and has earned the reputation of being the most popular Christmas attraction in western Canada. Visitors can get tickets to ride a miniature train that features live performances with a spectacular display of lights along the route. To keep yourself cozy, we highly recommend getting a hot chocolate before boarding the train.","copyright":"Christmas display at Stanley Park, Vancouver (© Michael Wheatley/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Stanley+Park&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191207_0500%22","date":"20191207","image":{"name":"OHR.NutcrackerStanley_EN-CA9840887346.jpg","hd":"/images/3D8739514227897E3CA8AEE925A4E0063226BBF69A0060F18F70EC023673D394.jpg","tmb":"/images/0118099FF3E6D49C81B3BFFFE8F8FF79342CC46E1A826F618F5E53E83A151E77.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerStanley_EN-CA9840887346_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerStanley_EN-CA9840887346_tmb.jpg"}}
