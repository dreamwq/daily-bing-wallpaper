{"title":"A big place to shop small","caption":"A big place to shop small","desc":"Jemaa el-Fnaa is situated in the medina quarter of Marrakesh, Morocco, in the old part of the city. Souks (markets) like this one have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers, and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing, and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different specialties and takes on traditional Moroccan food.","copyright":"Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh (Â© Pavliha/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jemaa+el-Fnaa+Square&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191129_0500%22","date":"20191129","image":{"name":"OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-CA4379445194.jpg","hd":"/images/E3938A744D9073066AA45D87569B2F22238054208346E8BA65057AB6FBB7ECCB.jpg","tmb":"/images/78284074A094818475C31050B435A293384FC13D6A0BA88A17E2AC9C88C70C86.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-CA4379445194_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-CA4379445194_tmb.jpg"}}
