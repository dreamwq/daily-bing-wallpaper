Commemorative events are held across the nation to remember the fallen and acknowledge those who continue to serve our country. Pictured here is a memorial site from Vimy Ridge in France. It was at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, during the First World War, where the four divisions of Canadian Corps fought together, making it the nation’s most celebrated victory.","copyright":"Battle site encompassing Commonwealth graves, historical remains and a memorial and interpretation centre at Vimy Ridge, France (© David Broadbent/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Remembrance+Day&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191111_0500%22","date":"20191111","image":{"name":"OHR.VimyPoppy_EN-CA1744017148.jpg","hd":"/images/4EA8420170CCF1B8129E7916E8D00C8703993C16C7E839202222ED99641F18AB.jpg","tmb":"/images/8EFD1BEF8C0EDBD6306975F8EE1EB9F9AE2FB0D7F0EA5F16E47B1E5574A70564.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VimyPoppy_EN-CA1744017148_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VimyPoppy_EN-CA1744017148_tmb.jpg"}}
