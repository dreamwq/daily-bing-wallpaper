{"title":"Atop the ‘roof’ of Africa","caption":"Atop the ‘roof’ of Africa","desc":"From their home in the Siemen Mountains of Ethiopia, these rare gelada monkeys look like they’re on top of the world. Simien Mountains National Park is home to some of the highest elevations in all of Africa, marked by deep valleys, jagged mountains, and sheer cliffs. This harsh climate nurtures rare and endangered species, including our homepage friends. The gelada lives only here in the Ethiopian highlands, where it survives on a diet primarily comprised of grass. Nicknamed the ‘bleeding-heart monkey,’ it’s recognizable by the bright red, hour-glassed shaped patch on its chest. It has another claim to fame: This chatty species produces a diverse range of vocalizations so complex they’re thought to be similar to humans. So, what do you think they’re talking about?","copyright":"Gelada monkeys in Simien Mountains National Park, Northern Ethiopia (© Marco Gaiotti/plainpicture)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gelada+monkey&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191120_0500%22","date":"20191120","image":{"name":"OHR.SimienGelada_EN-CA0928382392.jpg","hd":"/images/253F4D8A11237449DE040BC0C8753F5D8DE59939EB857E76E8A893C9AD1037F8.jpg","tmb":"/images/7AB95C3AB5CFF8B09E86537689DFB31EBC8A4850F4AC27309CEB961C70999B39.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SimienGelada_EN-CA0928382392_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SimienGelada_EN-CA0928382392_tmb.jpg"}}
