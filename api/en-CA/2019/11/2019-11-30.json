The Cavalcade of Lights is an annual festive event held in Nathan Philips Square in downtown Toronto. With a live DJ, ice-skating party, musical performances and a picturesque display of fireworks, Torontonians of all ages flock over here. What was originally intended as a one-night exhibit, has been extended to a month-long event since 2002. So, if you’re unable to make it tonight, there is plenty of time to participate in the city’s holiday tradition.","copyright":"Christmas Lights and Christmas tree at Nathan Phillips square, Toronto (© Bert Hoferichter/AgeFotostock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=nathan+phillips+square&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191130_0500%22","date":"20191130","image":{"name":"OHR.CavalcadeTree_EN-CA6055230816.jpg","hd":"/images/99816D41C60A70ECA1F93A8510E7DFC209F919EE537BAAD87EAFB49C00F4F301.jpg","tmb":"/images/7F2F6C9291F1CC4BC19EBD2D84751421B9A9D0028C14044C41C8D1B2FD4A6F78.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CavalcadeTree_EN-CA6055230816_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CavalcadeTree_EN-CA6055230816_tmb.jpg"}}
