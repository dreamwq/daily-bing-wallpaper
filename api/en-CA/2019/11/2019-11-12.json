{"title":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","caption":"Sleep tight, little hedgehog","desc":"Though they may seem exotic to most people in the Americas, wild hedgehogs are quite common in much of the rest of the world. The tiny creatures are usually nocturnal and use their spiky exterior to protect themselves. Each hedgehog has about 6,000 quills, but the quills aren't poisonous and don't easily detach, like those of the also-quilled (but completely unrelated) porcupine.","copyright":"Baby hedgehog (Â© lorenzo104/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=hedgehog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191112_0500%22","date":"20191112","image":{"name":"OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-CA9852035066.jpg","hd":"/images/7BA7AE8F9236F0C0FFBE84B3468AC78A4D25F092D211D872974FA76B421E0CEB.jpg","tmb":"/images/AE313B31E16FEB3127F2ECB75DFFA4CE86802D69C79A6D4ECED96B2BE11F0951.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-CA9852035066_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyHedgehog_EN-CA9852035066_tmb.jpg"}}
