{"title":"The Cutty Sark turns 150","caption":"The Cutty Sark turns 150","desc":"We're featuring the Cutty Sark in today's image to mark the 150th anniversary of her launch on Nov. 22, 1869. Built for speed, this extreme clipper ship began its abbreviated career as a tea clipper racing across oceans 'at a clip' (hence the designation 'clipper ship') to deliver the season's first tea harvest to England. While at times the Cutty Sark was considered one of the fastest ships in the world, its practical use as a cargo ship was ending almost as soon as it was launched. That's because steamships using the much shorter route through the newly opened Suez Canal were able to deliver the highly anticipated tea harvest faster and cheaper. In 1883, the Cutty Sark began hauling wool from Australia, but within 10 years steamships also disrupted this business.","copyright":"The Cutty Sark in Greenwich, London, England for her 150th anniversary (Â© Grant Rooney Premium/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=cutty+sark+museum+greenwich&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191122_0500%22","date":"20191122","image":{"name":"OHR.CuttySark150_EN-CA3708257189.jpg","hd":"/images/2EAFE24AE662E0D9186012E96FE4BA7E115C455F4662B2566D0AE32B983B0F8B.jpg","tmb":"/images/34420B1C68695D5E91F2D902F2CF08D70E4074E841FCCC005A05E54BC7ABE147.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuttySark150_EN-CA3708257189_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuttySark150_EN-CA3708257189_tmb.jpg"}}
