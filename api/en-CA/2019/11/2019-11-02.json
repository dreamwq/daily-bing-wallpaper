It received the status of a provincial park in 1995. With rolling grasslands, hoodoos, river valleys and cliffs, the Junction Sheep Range Provincial Park serves as a habitat for numerous endangered species. It provides a critical breeding ground for California bighorn sheep who feed on grass and low-lying plants.
