{"title":"Make an impact","caption":"Celebrating achievements and contributions","desc":"Ever since 1992, the month of October has been designated as Women's History Month by the Government of Canada. It is a time to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of women across the country. The theme for this year is 'Make An Impact,' in honour of the female pioneers who shaped our nation and contributed to its progress in fields such as arts, politics and science. October is the chosen month since it includes the International Day of the Girl on October 11 and Persons Day on October 18.","copyright":"Women's March in Victoria, B.C.
