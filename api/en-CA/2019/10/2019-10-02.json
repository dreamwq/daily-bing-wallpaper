{"title":"A poetic landscape","caption":"Land of lochs and forests","desc":"Where better to enjoy the changing of the seasons than Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park? Here, woodlands made up of millions of Scots pine, oak, larch, rowan and Atlantic oakwood trees offer a refuge for protected species like red deer and golden eagles as well as black grouse, otters and red squirrels. Situated on the southern edge of the Highlands, Scotland’s first national park also offers more than 1,800 square kilometres of misty mountains, rugged hills, sparkling lochs, rivers and villages.  Loch Lomond itself is Britain’s largest freshwater lake at 71 square kilometres.","copyright":"The Trossachs National Park in autumn, Stirling, Scotland (© Jon Arnold/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Trossachs+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191002_0400%22","date":"20191002","image":{"name":"OHR.TrossachsAutumn_EN-CA6848663740.jpg","hd":"/images/002F2A3AE6558F523E9449EF0FA923211592F4BF0E56942FAB958D5C161E77F0.jpg","tmb":"/images/992A56FC80056350DCF6B08550A40E488DD5B46B9E7B4354A7A8EDF3877152D5.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrossachsAutumn_EN-CA6848663740_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrossachsAutumn_EN-CA6848663740_tmb.jpg"}}
