{"title":"The height of pumpkin season","caption":"The height of pumpkin season","desc":"The Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival displays enormous champion pumpkins weighing over a thousand pounds, hosts live pumpkin carving demonstrations, and offers really every kind of pumpkin-related food you can imagine, from pies to pumpkin flavoured artisanal cocktails. Plus, Gourdy, the anthropomorphized pumpkin mascot. While California is the leader in the consumer pumpkin harvest, it is only the second-largest producer in the country. Illinois grows approximately a quarter of the two billion pounds of pumpkins the U.S. produces yearly, though 80 percent of that ends up as pie filling or other processed products. Pumpkins require between 90-120 days to mature, so most are planted by late May or early June to coincide with our Halloween carving needs.","copyright":"Aerial view of a pumpkin patch in Half Moon Bay, California (Â© Tinker Street/Michael O'Neal/Gallery Stock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=half+moon+bay+california&form=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191019_0400%22","date":"20191019","image":{"name":"OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-CA3257472969.jpg","hd":"/images/9E28503FB4983DB0AC08BE0639404F8D4159E0E0C99FC436375D3982D5BA617E.jpg","tmb":"/images/F1E7BABA29109344819B15C7DDF3048A20781D4BB9D50E13F1AA6FCD70FB4625.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-CA3257472969_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-CA3257472969_tmb.jpg"}}
