Flying hundreds of miles across the open ocean, these dragonflies are known as globe skimmers, which refers to their migratory behaviour. Until about 20 years ago, no one knew where they came from. But researchers have since discovered that the dragonflies take advantage of moving weather systems and monsoon rains to complete their epic migration across the Arabian Sea from India.","copyright":"Close-up of a dragonfly wing (Â© Azwar Thaufeeq/500px/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=dragonflies&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191015_0400%22","date":"20191015","image":{"name":"OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-CA3876987541.jpg","hd":"/images/8F8A1E228DC65DD6B1B873F4B08B0ABD48A3D1EC369FA56CEB8564E1D2A8020D.jpg","tmb":"/images/867ED7DD06348AEF646C04D7215148B6227413D4D1AC9898E54C590FA55D7A7B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-CA3876987541_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesDragonfly_EN-CA3876987541_tmb.jpg"}}
