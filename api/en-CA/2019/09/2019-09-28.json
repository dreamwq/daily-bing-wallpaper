It might surprise you to learn however, that the tree isn’t actually native to Australia. Commonly mistaken as a local species, the Jacanarda’s roots lie in Brazil. Early sources believe that in around 1818 the Jacaranda mimosifolia species was collected and returned to the Royal Gardens at Kew, England, while plant hunter Allan Cunningham was sent on from Rio de Janeiro to New South Wales, where he would come to serve as a colonial botanist.","copyright":"Blooming jacaranda trees in New Farm Park, Brisbane, Australia (© Walter Bibikow/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Jacaranda+Trees&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190928_0400%22","date":"20190928","image":{"name":"OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-CA6348677879.jpg","hd":"/images/37444948F46028262D58859FDA8BF0E5680C6C83A3E7B9494B45CF864D865EB0.jpg","tmb":"/images/1053C1F011C7E20FE182C3189CD22BCB4504480EE3650AA6DAFFE2FCD53A03E6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-CA6348677879_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingJacaranda_EN-CA6348677879_tmb.jpg"}}
