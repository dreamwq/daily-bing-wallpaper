{"title":"Bridge of Hillsborough County","caption":"Bridge of Hillsborough County","desc":"The County Bridge has offered a picturesque passage over the Contoocook River in southern New Hampshire (New England region, northeastern United States) since 1937, when it replaced its covered predecessor that had been destroyed in a flood. But why even build a covered bridge? In a word, longevity. The roof and walls help protect the timber supports from rot. For comparison, an uncovered wooden bridge lasts an average of 20 years, while the covered variety can reach 100 years or more.","copyright":"County Bridge in New Hampshire, USA (Â© Denis Tangney Jr/E+/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Covered+bridge+in+New+Hampshire&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191023_1830%22","date":"20191023","image":{"name":"OHR.CountyBridge_EN-IN0215938188.jpg","hd":"/images/63A3E533FE71E15F74CA679ABF775BB468A1A4020B08595641BAD473BE1CCA3D.jpg","tmb":"/images/A574EF81EAEEA471AA2A0FBE55BBBC7DD848CFB7C3DF2C0D64C68108CAE31E5A.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CountyBridge_EN-IN0215938188_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CountyBridge_EN-IN0215938188_tmb.jpg"}}
