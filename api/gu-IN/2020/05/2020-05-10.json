{"title":"A tree amid the Tetons","caption":"A tree amid the Tetons","desc":"This limber pine standing alone in the sage brush flats has a name—Old Patriarch. A favourite subject of nature photographers in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park (Western United States), Old Patriarch is thought to be more than a thousand years old. The 'Cathedral Group' of the Teton Mountains forms a breathtaking backdrop, bursting up from the valley floor below and stretching dramatically to the soaring peaks. The national park spreads out below the spires for 310,000 acres, creating a home for extraordinary wildlife, pristine lakes, and alpine terrain. Sounds like the Old Patriarch has found quite a home for himself.","copyright":"The Old Patriarch Tree of Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA (© George Sanker/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=grand+teton+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200510_1830%22","date":"20200510","image":{"name":"OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-IN9581100082.jpg","hd":"/images/A85745A7F394F27171A6BB63166993DA1D9C3118F372F443C16F4CDC159A6CE5.jpg","tmb":"/images/1272ABD53291563BA720D231ACB7DC3035C77FCAA7F4C0B97BFBD1BD138124D3.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-IN9581100082_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldPatriarchTree_EN-IN9581100082_tmb.jpg"}}
