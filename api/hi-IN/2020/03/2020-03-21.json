Stepwells originated in western India over a thousand years ago as a way to easily and reliably access freshwater—even during the driest months. The Panna Meena Ka Kund stepwell in Jaipur is a classic example of the beautiful, regular, geometric architecture used to produce these useful public works. Most stepwells also feature shaded side chambers where locals (primarily women) can gather to escape the heat of the day.","copyright":"Women climbing a stepwell near Amber Fort in Jaipur, Rajasthan (© Shanna Baker/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=world+water+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200321_1830%22","date":"20200321","image":{"name":"OHR.StepWell_EN-IN2850385066.jpg","hd":"/images/FF4908213654F119E443CAC579C222D0F701544342DE9259E16199965187F0A2.jpg","tmb":"/images/448E9B1E2D21D17DBB7F968C77B26080ADA074F32076AA5BF0432BFB1BDE3A46.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-IN2850385066_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StepWell_EN-IN2850385066_tmb.jpg"}}
