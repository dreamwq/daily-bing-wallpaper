The most famous of these - and the oldest – is the marble cenotaph of Raja Jai Singh II. Its dome has sculptures representing 18 apsaras and gandharvas (nymphs and celestial musicians).","copyright":"View from the Gaitore Cenotaphs near Jaipur, Rajasthan (© Gekkon/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=gaitore+cenotaphs&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200329_1830%22","date":"20200329","image":{"name":"OHR.JaipurCenotaph_EN-IN9484217303.jpg","hd":"/images/E3C8E14D7706A3273746AEE08C89776A9E67636FE9C9936D43CE570F1C0FC348.jpg","tmb":"/images/B8A0E9C10D52801CE4E406A3F9C110E28DD19E4CF83939ACAC04A6CA57795A84.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JaipurCenotaph_EN-IN9484217303_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JaipurCenotaph_EN-IN9484217303_tmb.jpg"}}
