{"title":"Cork reserve on the Iberian Peninsula","caption":"The largest cork reserve on the Iberian Peninsula","desc":"Los Alcornocales is one of the largest natural parks in Spain. It is located between the provinces of Cadiz and Malaga, occupies an area of almost 168,000 hectares and offers a variety of landscapes with which few places can compete; from the steep, narrow ravines where dozens of streams are born, to the thick mist-covered forests that we can see in our photograph today. Here you will find the largest population of corkscrews in the Iberian Peninsula, an indigenous tree that begins to be usable when it turns 35 or 40 years old.","copyright":"Cork tree forest (© Andrés M.
