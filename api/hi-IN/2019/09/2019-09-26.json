Our today’s picture has been taken in the Bardenas Reales, located in Navarra, in the north of Spain. This place of lunar landscapes surfaced millions of years ago, when the inland sea that occupied this territory withdrew leaving behind tons of sediments that later got eroded creating these amazing geological formations.","copyright":"Colourful sunset over Castildetierra, in the Natural Park of Bardenas Reales, Navarre, Spain (© Inigofotografia/iStock/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=bardenas+reales&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190926_1830%22","date":"20190926","image":{"name":"OHR.BardenasDesert_EN-IN1282637185.jpg","hd":"/images/86C5427623DFD777BAC585D27C5AD8B602985310619ABCB0AE6FCC26977C9D17.jpg","tmb":"/images/C568F4491ED1951204B16B2D89539DEA5B52039B5574B8C142A41ABA02733E29.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BardenasDesert_EN-IN1282637185_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BardenasDesert_EN-IN1282637185_tmb.jpg"}}
