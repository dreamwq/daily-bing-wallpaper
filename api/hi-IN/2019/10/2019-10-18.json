{"title":"The height of pumpkin season","caption":"The height of pumpkin season","desc":"Today the people of California Bay Area, USA,  observe the Half Moon Bay Art & Pumpkin Festival. The annual event displays enormous champion pumpkins weighing over 500 kilograms, hosts live pumpkin carving demonstrations, and offers really every kind of pumpkin-related food you can imagine, from pies to pumpkin flavoured artisanal cocktails. Plus, Gourdy, the anthropomorphized pumpkin mascot. While California is the leader in the consumer pumpkin harvest in the United States, it is only the second-largest producer in the country. The state of Illinois grows approximately a quarter of the 2 billion pounds of pumpkins the US produces yearly, though 80 percent of that ends up as pie filling or other processed products. Pumpkins require between 90-120 days to mature, so most are planted by late May or early June to coincide with Halloween carving needs.","copyright":"Aerial view of a pumpkin patch in Half Moon Bay, California (Â© Tinker Street/Michael O'Neal/Gallery Stock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=pumpkin+patch+half+moon+bay&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191018_1830%22","date":"20191018","image":{"name":"OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-IN9816037136.jpg","hd":"/images/9E28503FB4983DB0AC08BE0639404F8D4159E0E0C99FC436375D3982D5BA617E.jpg","tmb":"/images/F1E7BABA29109344819B15C7DDF3048A20781D4BB9D50E13F1AA6FCD70FB4625.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-IN9816037136_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HalfMoonBayPumpkin_EN-IN9816037136_tmb.jpg"}}
