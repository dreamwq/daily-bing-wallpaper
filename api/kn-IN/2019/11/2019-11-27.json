{"title":"The splendour of Las Catedrales","caption":"The splendour of Las Catedrales","desc":"The beach of Las Catedrales (The Cathedrals) we show you in today’s picture is one of the most beautiful and intriguing in Spain. Close to the Galician town of Ribadeo, its official name is Aguas Santas beach (Holy Waters). It is more popularly known as ‘The Cathedrals’ because of the arches growing from the sand tongue, which resemble the buttresses of a Catholic church. They’re believed to be naturally carved by the action of saltwater and wind over millions of years. Local legends tell us there’s a door in this place connecting with the beyond.","copyright":"Las Catedrales beach, Galicia, Spain (© Davide Seddio/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Las+Catedrals+beach&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191127_1830%22","date":"20191127","image":{"name":"OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-IN1774969457.jpg","hd":"/images/737A2B12534FEF2C4D09E725A6A6A1387C646500FA835CDAEA8E4F65B4022A57.jpg","tmb":"/images/FB322F791810F02D955674866014B0CB4202D4D132766909EEFC15B118AC404E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-IN1774969457_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasCatedralesBeach_EN-IN1774969457_tmb.jpg"}}
