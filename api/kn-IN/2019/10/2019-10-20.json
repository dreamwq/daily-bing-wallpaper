On this day 93 years ago, the first Pooh book was published and the beloved “bear of very little brain” went on to become a favourite with children across the world. It was here in Ashdown Forest, in East Sussex, that author A A Milne was inspired by his son Christopher Robin’s own adventures with his soft toys. The forest, which sits on the highest ridge of the beautiful High Weald landscape, includes a real-life Five Hundred Acre Wood as well as other spots that fans will recognise from the books.","copyright":"Ashdown Forest, Misty Sunrise, East Sussex, United Kingdom (© Tim Stocker Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=ashdown+forest+&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220191020_1830%22","date":"20191020","image":{"name":"OHR.MistyAshdown_EN-IN2333738960.jpg","hd":"/images/EE145FD1945720A328D8EB32881372527C771BAC685DC39FCD3C004B2BDDC206.jpg","tmb":"/images/B32230BBEBA8FAF7287E49B2F7A2A9C1AF5531DBD0AA6E84601955C509C2B320.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MistyAshdown_EN-IN2333738960_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MistyAshdown_EN-IN2333738960_tmb.jpg"}}
