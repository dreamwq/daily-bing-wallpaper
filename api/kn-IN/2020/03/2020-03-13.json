{"title":"Going round in circles","caption":"Going round in circles","desc":"This striking bridge connecting areas around Copenhagen Harbour in the Danish capital, is something of a work of art which, when seen side on, gives the impression of a ship by the quay. Spanning a canal, its five interconnected circles each has its own ‘mast’, complete with steel cables threaded to the platforms. The circles vary in size and are arranged in a zig zag, designed to make the thousands of pedestrians and cyclists who use the route each day, slow down for a bit of reflection. The central section also swings back to allow boats to pass through.","copyright":"The Circle Bridge in Copenhagen, Denmark (© Lingxiao Xie/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=circle+bridge+copenhagen&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200313_1830%22","date":"20200313","image":{"name":"OHR.Cirkelbroen_EN-IN9054738214.jpg","hd":"/images/1EE2D1B53704DA7E7737271B3A2838CC2423A34D0EF41A8232574BB122D06358.jpg","tmb":"/images/6B876F9391E2CA50216BEB4BAC23584B3FA922271FA80D680297044B00F6C693.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Cirkelbroen_EN-IN9054738214_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Cirkelbroen_EN-IN9054738214_tmb.jpg"}}
