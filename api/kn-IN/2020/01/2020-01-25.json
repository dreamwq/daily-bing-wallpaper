It's on this day that India celebrates its official beginning as an independent democratic republic, its own constitution coming into effect after having endured nearly a century of British Raj. Republic Day events include presentations of the Padma Awards (national service honours), a Republic Day parade at Rajpath, New Delhi, and other ceremonies. Flag hoisting events take place in schools across the country and miniature flags can be seen adorning vehicles in every city.","copyright":"Military motorcycle stunt riders at Rajpath, on Republic Day 2013 (Â© AP Photo/Kevin Frayer)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=republic+day+india&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200125_1830%22","date":"20200125","image":{"name":"OHR.RepublicBikes_EN-IN9286587739.jpg","hd":"/images/35BC84349C42486AE48E2BC146AC10BC630965CEB36CB04C9A91D6A76F7BAA71.jpg","tmb":"/images/93A52C1BFDB22E753336E697128AE3B7B30728850A6AE163BA3EE776D821B3DE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RepublicBikes_EN-IN9286587739_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RepublicBikes_EN-IN9286587739_tmb.jpg"}}
