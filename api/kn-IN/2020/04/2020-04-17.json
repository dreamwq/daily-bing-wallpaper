{"title":"US National Parks Week begins","caption":"US National Parks Week begins","desc":"To kick off USA’s National Park Week, which starts today, we're travelling to Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, one of the most popular of US National Parks (California state). This time of year, the waterfall flows in a torrent over the edge of this cliff, but by late summer it can be reduced to a trickle of small streams slipping over the edge. Most years, May is the month to see Vernal Fall at full power, as the spring thaw in the mountains melts the snowpack, turning the falls into a raging tumble of water making its way to the valley floor where the Merced River flows.","copyright":"Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, California, USA (© elvistudio/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=yosemite+national+park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200417_1830%22","date":"20200417","image":{"name":"OHR.VernalFalls_EN-IN7795942606.jpg","hd":"/images/40D416F56F380D61CB1D700CC4814A05F8D1B0937143376D2E9330243B3560ED.jpg","tmb":"/images/A0047673D53C8EC1CD74539B12CC5772A3F6D1DC899B31BF53028DA0ABA1F413.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VernalFalls_EN-IN7795942606_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VernalFalls_EN-IN7795942606_tmb.jpg"}}
