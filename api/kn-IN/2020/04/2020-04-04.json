{"title":"The frog prince?","caption":"The frog prince?","desc":"Perched among the petals of a purple water lily, we think this petite treefrog makes a fine mascot for National Frog Month. The annual event celebrates frogs around the world, all 4,000+ species. Among the various kinds, the little green treefrog stands out as a popular pet. That’s due to its small size, friendly face, and low-maintenance lifestyle. It’s a common backyard animal in parts of the US. In India, its larger cousin of the Indirana variety is common, especially in the ghats.","copyright":"Green tree frog and purple water lily, Lake Kissimmee, Florida, USA (© Joanne Williams/Danita Delimont)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Green+tree+frog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200404_1830%22","date":"20200404","image":{"name":"OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-IN2858878971.jpg","hd":"/images/3211C9B485019AE2C8007989A59D87447C10A1A4B30E497EC136722A24568998.jpg","tmb":"/images/FD954B7BE5DDFC374C6B0B2C1DBA540547F014348BD8DF3A01DA98CD1DC076BA.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-IN2858878971_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KissimmeeFrog_EN-IN2858878971_tmb.jpg"}}
