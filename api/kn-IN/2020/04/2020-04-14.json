{"title":"The beautiful McLeod Ganj","caption":"The beautiful McLeod Ganj","desc":"Himachal Day is observed every April 15, which marks the day the province of Himachal was recognised in 1948 – although it didn’t get statehood status until 1971 (which calls for 2 anniversary days to this lucky state). Tucked away into the lap of the Himalayas, the word Himachal itself means ‘lap of snow’. What sets Himachal apart from most other states, is the comparative untouched beauty of its landscapes. Thanks to its calm and tranquil offerings, the province has served as adobe to legendary excursions by sages and wise men.","copyright":"Bhagsu waterfalls in the Dharamsala region, Himachal (© f9photos/iStock/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=himachal+pradesh&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200414_1830%22","date":"20200414","image":{"name":"OHR.HimachalFalls_EN-IN8528150673.jpg","hd":"/images/AD931BB3A4EF3986C44ECE08328EC41CECEE5457E10957B567B99719A643F87B.jpg","tmb":"/images/11AC6C3772BC83FD284E91D07F0522C5F10186FE8D7F303B22CE8FFF8E0A9734.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HimachalFalls_EN-IN8528150673_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HimachalFalls_EN-IN8528150673_tmb.jpg"}}
