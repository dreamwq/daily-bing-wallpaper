{"title":"The sacred hills of Shatrunjaya","caption":"The sacred hills of Shatrunjaya","desc":"Today, for Mahavir Jayanti, we take you to the sacred (Jain) hills of Shatrunjaya (originally known as Pundarikgiri) in Gujarat. Shantrunjaya literally means ‘place of victory over inner enemies.’  Located near Palitana city, the hill hosts 865 Jain temples. Why is this hill so important to Jains? It is here that the first tirthankara of Jainism, Rishabha, gave his first sermon. The place also holds significance as Rishabha’s son made a shrine here, and grandson Pundarika Swami is believed to have attained moksha here. Today, the hill stands as a symbol of Jain heritage.","copyright":"Jain temples on top of Shantrujaya hill, Palitana, Gujarat (© Aliaksandr Mazurkevich/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Shatrunjaya&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200405_1830%22","date":"20200405","image":{"name":"OHR.ShatrunjayaHill_EN-IN0445917347.jpg","hd":"/images/13601ADDBBF59A83821D842436AEBC08DFC4603D6A1A2C8BA500D894B418265F.jpg","tmb":"/images/B09EDF79540E7B3962F588CED401DF4EF5E1E5D9BA3437BA2B59A8A738168F63.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShatrunjayaHill_EN-IN0445917347_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShatrunjayaHill_EN-IN0445917347_tmb.jpg"}}
