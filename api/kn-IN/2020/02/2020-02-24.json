{"title":"Jazzed for Mardi Gras","caption":"Jazzed for Mardi Gras","desc":"To celebrate the New Orleans’ (Louisiana, United States) enduring legacy of music, we're in the Tremé neighborhood of the ‘Big Easy’, as the city is fondly called. As Carnival season culminates today with Mardi Gras celebrations throughout the city, this historically black neighbourhood adjacent to the French Quarter will come alive with the music of jazz bands like the one depicted here. The sculptural profile of a traditional marching brass band marks one entrance to Louis Armstrong Park, a community space honouring New Orleans' musical roots with a 12-foot statue of its jazz legend namesake, as well as other art pieces depicting iconic musicians.","copyright":"The Roots of Music Cultural Sculpture Garden in Louis Armstrong Park, New Orleans, USA (© jejim120/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Louis+Armstrong+Park+New+Orleans&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200224_1830%22","date":"20200224","image":{"name":"OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-IN4068348771.jpg","hd":"/images/1D4EA9183BB36F185182510518E68DA63EEF85EC414927DD4B12C914AFFE4AD4.jpg","tmb":"/images/0A8E17E0E8158BA0DAD6148CA573E77AD393F22F3C6B8249B100CDD1B52A696C.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-IN4068348771_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArmstrongPark_EN-IN4068348771_tmb.jpg"}}
