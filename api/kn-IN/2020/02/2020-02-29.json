{"title":"The beautiful woods of Janjehli, Himachal","caption":"The beautiful woods of Janjehli, Himachal","desc":"Located in the Kulu-Manali region of Himachal Pradesh, are the calm and tranquil woods of Janjehli. This hiker’s paradise is a good place to make base, while you plan treks to surrounding places of interest. And apart from the thick tropical forest which itself is worth the visit, look out for the guest house deep within the forest at Bajahi. Other places of interest close-by include the Shikari Devi temple, and the Kamrunag temple with the sacred lake close to it.","copyright":"Scenic deep tropical forest of Janjehli, Himalayas (© KS-Art/iStock/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=janjheli+forest&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200229_1830%22","date":"20200229","image":{"name":"OHR.JanjheliForest_EN-IN1994744612.jpg","hd":"/images/3C8718DE443062E8AA3242FC8715F96973BADF56BFB8D7989CB7BA63D26D2275.jpg","tmb":"/images/DACB93F2E61924D203F1E081ACDE6EF8513507630D560D39CBA2E018E8074448.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JanjheliForest_EN-IN1994744612_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JanjheliForest_EN-IN1994744612_tmb.jpg"}}
