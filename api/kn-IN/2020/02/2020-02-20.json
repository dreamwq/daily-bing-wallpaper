A short ferry ride away from Mumbai’s Gateway of India takes you to Elephanta Island, where the caves, dating back to the 2nd century BCE depict various forms of Shiva and Parvati, as well as some Buddhist stupas. Most of what you see at the caves is carved out of solid basalt rock. The 20-foot Trimurthi Sadashiva (Three faced Shiva) is the most prominent carving, while Natraj (God of dance) and Yogishwara (God of Yoga) are also celebrated attractions on Elephanta Island.","copyright":"Elephanta Island caves near Mumbai, Maharashtra (© Andrey Khrobostov/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=elephanta+caves&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200220_1830%22","date":"20200220","image":{"name":"OHR.ElephantaCaves_EN-IN6111402332.jpg","hd":"/images/8984B79458B55673F5CEE8DDEC0DD2D5292F1D348C49607B8F352D8E020D48DC.jpg","tmb":"/images/A393CD58706EDB8756E846E23D61D70DA90F2802D8715D220E9DCF1286A7318F.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantaCaves_EN-IN6111402332_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantaCaves_EN-IN6111402332_tmb.jpg"}}
