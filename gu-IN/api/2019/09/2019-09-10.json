A two-hour drive north of Cairns, the Daintree is positively ripe with adventure. Adrenaline junkies, for example, can zipline through the rainforest canopy, while those with a keen eye can cruise the waterways on the lookout for saltwater crocodiles. Regardless, covering 1200 square kilometres, the forest is said to present one of the most complex ecosystems on our planet. In fact, the scenery here is so beautiful that James Cameron reportedly drew inspiration from it for his hit movie ‘Avatar’, while Sir David Attenborough called it “the most extraordinary place on earth.” That’s good enough for us!","copyright":"Aerial view of rainforest and Daintree River, Australia (© Peter Adams/Offset)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Daintree+River&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190910_1830%22","date":"20190910","image":{"name":"OHR.DaintreeRiver_EN-IN9008520400.jpg","hd":"/images/E469F7FB539469FF12E3F97A3C80995B606A3553BB5926889AA4F6E1059BAE5A.jpg","tmb":"/images/D2EB017AAE440200EC5A68B64B3AE2F3AAFBC69EC0BFAAA9C13D84981311BEC0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DaintreeRiver_EN-IN9008520400_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DaintreeRiver_EN-IN9008520400_tmb.jpg"}}
