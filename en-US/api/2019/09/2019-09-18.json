The second-most active volcano in South America, Villarrica is known to the indigenous Mapuche people as Rucapillán (Devil’s House). The eruption shown in this photo, which was taken on September 2, 2018, alarmed nearby residents, but it wasn’t nearly as destructive as other relatively recent eruptions, like one in 2015 that prompted authorities to evacuate thousands of people.","copyright":"The Villarrica volcano in Chile on September 2, 2018 (© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters)","copyrightonly":"© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters","copyrightlink":"/search?q=villarrica+volcano&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190918_0700%22","date":"20190918","image":{"name":"OHR.Villarrica_EN-US0968684000.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/92e179ede39751bafed5b7a9f5936ac57c50aadad784311c292b6d5f0a866170.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-US0968684000_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-US0968684000_tmb.jpg"}}
