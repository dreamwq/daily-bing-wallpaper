{"title":"A toast to California!","caption":"A toast to California!","desc":"Today we're celebrating the 169th anniversary of the Golden State's admission into the Union with an appropriately golden image of a Central Coast winery and landscape. In 1850, just 14 months after the peace treaty ending the Mexican-American War ceded most of California along with a large portion of western territory to the US, the former self-proclaimed California Republic became the 31st state. California is one of only six states admitted to the Union without first being recognized as a US territory. Some link this to the California Gold Rush, which began in January 1848 and rapidly increased the California population by more than 1,000 percent.","copyright":"Central Coast vineyards in Arroyo Grande, California (Â© Ian Shive/Tandem Motion + Stills)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=california+admission+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190909_0700%22","date":"20190909","image":{"name":"OHR.ArroyoGrande_EN-US7955557721.jpg","hd":"/images/186D68A5149322A406205C3CE6B1D6B19AB55BA828E8A2384E74684FB9F70D52.jpg","tmb":"/images/830FB4D9D24F37C1B3C1877C573EEF18D97101A4E8DCD22E28D5704187D76791.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArroyoGrande_EN-US7955557721_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArroyoGrande_EN-US7955557721_tmb.jpg"}}
