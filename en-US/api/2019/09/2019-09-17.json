{"title":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day","caption":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day","desc":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day is a single celebration that commemorates the formation and signing of the US Constitution while also recognizing both naturalized citizens and those born in the US. It's a day to learn about these subjects, as well as a day many people become naturalized citizens in group ceremonies. (On average, about 700,000 people become US citizens every year.) To celebrate, we're looking at an unusual close-up of the Statue of Liberty, a welcoming sight to immigrants and a symbol of freedom since 1886. The statue's tablet has the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) inscribed in Roman numerals: JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.","copyright":"Detail of the Statue of Liberty, on Liberty Island, New York (Â© Judy Dillon/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=constitution+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190917_0700%22","date":"20190917","image":{"name":"OHR.LibertyDetail_EN-US8653321844.jpg","hd":"/images/49A6D19ABD49C3A2CFEC03137E847618281C08B073582165AB6427639F03EC63.jpg","tmb":"/images/2FC3EB3864CAD867B89260174117689509E4C546FED96A7364CDABB7D8E8ADD6.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LibertyDetail_EN-US8653321844_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LibertyDetail_EN-US8653321844_tmb.jpg"}}
