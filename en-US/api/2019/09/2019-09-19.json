{"title":"Fall for birding","caption":"Fall for birding","desc":"This common loon is spreading its wings in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota, near the US border with Canada and along the northern bank of Lake Superior. As temperatures cool, the protected area becomes a birder's paradise while migrating flocks stop over on their flights south. The Superior National Forest’s 3.9 million acres and 2,000 lakes offer the right combination of water, woods, and wetlands to support over 155 species of birds, the most avian diversity found in any US national forest.","copyright":"A common loon in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota (© Jim Brandenburg/Minden Pictures)","copyrightonly":"© Jim Brandenburg/Minden Pictures","copyrightlink":"/search?q=common+loon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190919_0700%22","date":"20190919","image":{"name":"OHR.CommonLoon_EN-US1124304576.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/2823aaa98ae0ec919b3c0492dffaf5148e4f3216b27bf281f7a320719ceac381.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CommonLoon_EN-US1124304576_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CommonLoon_EN-US1124304576_tmb.jpg"}}
