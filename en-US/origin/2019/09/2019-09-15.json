Why does National Hispanic Heritage Month begin on September 15 and not at the start of the month? The date was chosen because September 15 marks the anniversary of independence for five Latin American countries—Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras—places from which many Latin Americans in the US and their ancestors have immigrated. The monthlong celebration is marked with events throughout the country, from an annual festival in Fayetteville, Arkansas, to ceremonies within all branches of the US military.","date":"Sep 15, 2019","bsTitle":"A light on National Hispanic Heritage Month","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190915_TheVochol%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"2287a28ec24873a7a22d1ea3bf15e682","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheVochol_EN-US8201280174_tmb.jpg","title":"A light on National Hispanic Heritage Month","desc":"Today marks the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month, a holiday to recognize the vital contributions made by Hispanic and Latino people…","hash":"C/MeA9RtSNYtEWPY+7adTaeKEdIs2jtU3rpppUEkLsk="}},{"startdate":"20190914","fullstartdate":"201909140700","enddate":"20190915","url":"/th?id=OHR.ToothWalkingSeahorse_EN-US8055541483_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ToothWalkingSeahorse_EN-US8055541483","copyright":"Walruses near Kvitøya in the Svalbard archipelago, Norway (© Ole Jorgen Liodden/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=walrus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190914_0700%22","title":"I am the walrus","caption":"I am the walrus","copyrightonly":"© Ole Jorgen Liodden/Minden Pictures","desc":"This herd of gentle giants is bobbing in the waters of the Svalbard archipelago, roughly midway between continental Norway and the North Pole.

At other times in the performance, the drones created the shape of Chinese characters reading 'Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!' So, what is the Mid-Autumn Festival? It’s a harvest celebration that’s been observed by Chinese and other Asian peoples for thousands of years. The date of the celebration changes each year on our Gregorian calendar, falling on the first full moon of the harvest season, which arrives today. One major feature of the lunar holiday? A sweet pastry called 'mooncake.' Let it be known that we fully embrace any holiday that includes cake.","date":"Sep 13, 2019","bsTitle":"The 'moon' rises for Mid-Autumn Festival","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190913_DroneGlobe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"b625824ae8d24cd557a6ea779cbe2f29","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DroneGlobe_EN-US8460462558_tmb.jpg","title":"The 'moon' rises for Mid-Autumn Festival","desc":"Shenzhen, China—seen in our photo today—is a drone manufacturing hub.

Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above.

Together they cover 8,036 square miles, with the East park consisting of flat, dry plains, and the West including mountains, volcanoes, lakes, and springs. The gerenuk (which means giraffe-necked antelope in Somali) is a long-necked antelope also known as the giraffe gazelle. It uses its lengthy neck and ability to stand on its hind legs to nibble on shrubs and trees that other types of antelope can't reach. It's less social then other gazelles, so seeing one alone, as we are in this photo, is common.","date":"Sep 10, 2019","bsTitle":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190910_TsavoGerenuk%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"abc7058d85e2b7f3306267fa2fd0bfec","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TsavoGerenuk_EN-US8038094057_tmb.jpg","title":"Welcome to my neck of the woods","desc":"It's peak tourist season in the Tsavo region of Kenya, when the weather's cooler and dry—a good time to spot wildlife like this gerenuk in…","hash":"ftHK+FLlEVYqXkUXV1yozJ54wF5+MIB7P9WBJCFpl2M="}},{"startdate":"20190909","fullstartdate":"201909090700","enddate":"20190910","url":"/th?id=OHR.ArroyoGrande_EN-US7955557721_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ArroyoGrande_EN-US7955557721","copyright":"Central Coast vineyards in Arroyo Grande, California (© Ian Shive/Tandem Motion + Stills)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=california+admission+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190909_0700%22","title":"A toast to California!","caption":"A toast to California!","copyrightonly":"© Ian Shive/Tandem Motion + Stills","desc":"Today we're celebrating the 169th anniversary of the Golden State's admission into the Union with an appropriately golden image of a Central Coast winery and landscape.
