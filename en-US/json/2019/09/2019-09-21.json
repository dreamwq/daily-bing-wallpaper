Since 2000, this exhibit, created by artist Clara Halter and architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, has been inspiring visitors to write their own messages of peace and place them in gaps intentionally created in the structure for that purpose. To mark the International Day of Peace, hundreds of events around the world are being held today, including peace fairs, music concerts, meditations, and more. The UN declared it a 'day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples.' One of the events today is at UN Headquarters in New York, where the secretary-general will ring the Peace Bell and participants will observe a minute of silence.","date":"Sep 21, 2019","bsTitle":"'The Wall for Peace'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190921_WallofPeace%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"71fe6457643d0d02eaf6a7ba5cc839fb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WallofPeace_EN-US2369061516_tmb.jpg","title":"'The Wall for Peace'","desc":"In today's image, we're featuring 'The Wall for Peace' in Paris for the International Day of Peace.
