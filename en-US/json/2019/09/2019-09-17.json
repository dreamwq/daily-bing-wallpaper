It's a day to learn about these subjects, as well as a day many people become naturalized citizens in group ceremonies. (On average, about 700,000 people become US citizens every year.) To celebrate, we're looking at an unusual close-up of the Statue of Liberty, a welcoming sight to immigrants and a symbol of freedom since 1886. The statue's tablet has the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) inscribed in Roman numerals: JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.","date":"Sep 17, 2019","bsTitle":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190917_LibertyDetail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2de1ba548ba69165e6c4bf96b4db37ab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LibertyDetail_EN-US8653321844_tmb.jpg","title":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day","desc":"Constitution Day and Citizenship Day is a single celebration that commemorates the formation and signing of the US Constitution while also…","hash":"lYs93UHQ5CxUAAXSKDNwJd2LgTAknx6F6onCNVKLdHU="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
