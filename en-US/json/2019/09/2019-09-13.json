So, when this city celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival in 2018, a synchronized fleet of drones took to the skies over Shenzhen Talent Park and lit up in a crescent-moon shape to celebrate the lunar holiday. At other times in the performance, the drones created the shape of Chinese characters reading 'Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!' So, what is the Mid-Autumn Festival? It’s a harvest celebration that’s been observed by Chinese and other Asian peoples for thousands of years. The date of the celebration changes each year on our Gregorian calendar, falling on the first full moon of the harvest season, which arrives today. One major feature of the lunar holiday? A sweet pastry called 'mooncake.' Let it be known that we fully embrace any holiday that includes cake.","date":"Sep 13, 2019","bsTitle":"The 'moon' rises for Mid-Autumn Festival","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190913_DroneGlobe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"b625824ae8d24cd557a6ea779cbe2f29","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DroneGlobe_EN-US8460462558_tmb.jpg","title":"The 'moon' rises for Mid-Autumn Festival","desc":"Shenzhen, China—seen in our photo today—is a drone manufacturing hub.
