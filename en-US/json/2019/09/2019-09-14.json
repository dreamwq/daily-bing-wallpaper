Walruses spend more than half their day in the water, masterfully foraging for clams and other marine organisms. The rest of the time, they hang out on ice floes, the males and females huddled separately, taking a break before diving in for more food. Walruses launch from the ice to eat, making the floating blocks an important part of their survival. With the effects of climate change increasing, Arctic ice is melting, posing an existential threat to the ancient pinnipeds.","date":"Sep 14, 2019","bsTitle":"I am the walrus","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190914_ToothWalkingSeahorse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3774b62f0488be08d5a2e4ad2f071ebe","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ToothWalkingSeahorse_EN-US8055541483_tmb.jpg","title":"I am the walrus","desc":"This herd of gentle giants is bobbing in the waters of the Svalbard archipelago, roughly midway between continental Norway and the North…","hash":"TAvfjrDLsSFVWVSRJKBdn6O2/1/+C54zS/BeOYhCyek="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
