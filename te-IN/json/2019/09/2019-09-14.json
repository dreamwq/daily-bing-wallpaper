With a population of under 100,000, the Jaisalmer Palace stands majestic over it. The fort, and many of the houses in the town of Jaisalmer are built with finely sculpted sandstone. The ‘Golden City’ as it is fondly known, is a testimony to the skills available with local sculptors in 1156 AD, when it was founded by the Bhati ruler Rawal Jaisal. Jalis like the one that you see on today’s homepage, with intricate geometric designs – are a common site inside the Jaisalmer Palace. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Rajasthan.","date":"Sep 15, 2019","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190914_JaisalmerInterior%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"16b0400bdf73841ccd5e0270673f986e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JaisalmerInterior_EN-IN6200021941_tmb.jpg","title":"Inside the Jaisalmer Fort","desc":"Jaisalmer city stands on a ridge of yellow sandstone in the middle of the Thar desert.
