{"title":"San Sebastian Film Festival","caption":"San Sebastian Film Festival","desc":"San Sebastian International Film Festival opening today in the Basque Country is the most important cinema Fest in Spain and one of the fourteen most influential in the world. First edition dates back to 1953, which means it turns 67 today. Along its red carpet had showed off some of biggest names of celluloid history, from Alfred Hitchkock (who premiered his film Vertigo here in 1958) to Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Roman Polanski, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis or Ava Gardner. All of them had a special relationship with the festival and the city. Formerly the festival was held at Victoria Eugenia Theater, but since 1999 its headquarters moved to the avant-garde Kursaal Palace, the cube illuminated in today’s picture.","copyright":"San Sebastian and the Kursaal Palace, where the San Sebastian Film Festival is taking place (© Aljndr/iStock/Getty Images Plus)","copyrightonly":"© Aljndr/iStock/Getty Images Plus","copyrightlink":"/search?q=san+sebastian+international+film+festival&FORM=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190919_1830%22","date":"20190919","image":{"name":"OHR.SanSebastianFilm_EN-IN6214072609.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/dc06dcb96f89b8f2f54e2b4225a3b5af1f3f057bb3ce88d946e975eb6dbb9b1c.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SanSebastianFilm_EN-IN6214072609_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SanSebastianFilm_EN-IN6214072609_tmb.jpg"}}
