If you are surrounded by deciduous trees, you will witness leaves in shades of yellow, orange and red. The coloration of leaves is a result of a chemical process that slows down the tree’s food-making process. The carotenoids present in leaves create the yellow and orange pigment and anthocyanins produce hues of red and purple. To soak in the riot of colours, be sure to check the reports on fall foliage and don’t forget to rake the leaves from your yard.","date":"Sep 16, 2019","bsTitle":"Vibrant colours of Fall","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20190916_VancouverFall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"37aa6d905f711ece069164a382d6ae7c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VancouverFall_EN-CA6536075197_tmb.jpg","title":"Vibrant colours of Fall","desc":"With the first official day of Fall just around the corner, the days have gotten shorter, leaves have begun to change colours and trees have…","hash":"5r1xHFHs/BX9IcRpPZdy9ueOTkkzkTM8S5VtsPTKKMg="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
