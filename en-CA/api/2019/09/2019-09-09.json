{"title":"A lush, green escape","caption":"A lush, green escape","desc":"With the tourist season winding down and rainy season still forthcoming, September is an ideal time to visit Bali. If you’re lucky enough to go, plan a daytrip to the Tegallalang farming terraces in Ubud, where visitors can capture gorgeous photos of the landscape and get a unique glimpse into Balinese culture. The island of Bali has a rich tradition of agriculture, with an especially unique method of water management for rice farming. The irrigation system here, known as Subak, is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. Water flows through temples and into the rice paddies, carved into the hillsides like steps. It's a tradition that dates back thousands of years, based on the Balinese philosophical principle of Tri Hita Karana, which refers to a relationship between humans, the earth, and the gods.","copyright":"Tegallalang terrace farms in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia (© gorgeoussab/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ubud%2c+Bali&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190909_0400%22","date":"20190909","image":{"name":"OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522.jpg","hd":"/images/E137A3BAB8A58CD5FE5833477650936C0F557BE85D1F8876C4DA23FA5D078966.jpg","tmb":"/images/8D44D194CC23459FEF45E3765B77D95C9A54E73C7BD9ED18CA51C8A86FF65DDE.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Tegallalang_EN-CA2869296522_tmb.jpg"}}
