It's sweet flavour tends to pair well with spicy foods. The origins of its name lie in the German word 'Gewürz' for spice and Traminer for a village in Italy. If you have a taste palette for wine, you can identify the use of the Gewürztraminer grape by its low acidity, wholesome texture and fruity flavours like peach, apricot and mango. A major characteristic is its sweet scent similar to lychee, grapefruit and rose petals.
