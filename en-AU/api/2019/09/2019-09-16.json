Born in 2001, the event was launched to help increase awareness of Australian citizenship and provide another chance for all Australians to reflect on our common bond, democratic beliefs and achievements as a nation. Why September 17? Because today also happens to be the anniversary of the renaming of the Nationality and Citizenship Act - now known as the Australian Citizenship Act.","copyright":"True-colour image of Earth from Landsat satellites (© Planet Observer/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)","copyrightonly":"© Planet Observer/Universal Images Group via Getty Images","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Australian+Citizenship+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190916_1400%22","date":"20190916","image":{"name":"OHR.AtlasAustralia_EN-AU5875279031.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/069416263c0949482d097beca1895aaabc93c0c969fd2bafa9d1dfbe39d77f6e.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AtlasAustralia_EN-AU5875279031_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AtlasAustralia_EN-AU5875279031_tmb.jpg"}}
