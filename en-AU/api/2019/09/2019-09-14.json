At first glance, visitors likely see a massive grove of quaking aspen trees, their leaves dancing in the wind. But the Pando is not many trees; instead, it's a single organism. Like many aspen groves, each of the 40,000 trees in the Pando are genetically identical stems that sprout from the same root system.","copyright":"The Pando quaking aspen in Fishlake National Forest, Utah (© Don Paulson/Danita Delimont)","copyrightonly":"© Don Paulson/Danita Delimont","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pando+tree&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190914_1400%22","date":"20190914","image":{"name":"OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263.jpg","hd":"/image/3710fd85d65cbdb71a0e7113220892cbb34d5683b61b0a98b0e6b1e4ad1fc44a.jpg","tmp":"/image/0c1896cbbb956d41ae11d69c919692958d3be184a3d93f00cb4086814181f6b7.jpg","binghd":"https://global.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThePando_EN-AU5808519263_tmb.jpg"}}
