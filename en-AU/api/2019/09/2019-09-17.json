The second-most active volcano in South America, Villarrica is known to the indigenous Mapuche people as Rucapillán (Devil’s House). This photo was taken on September 2, 2018, alarming nearby residents, but it wasn’t nearly as destructive as other relatively recent eruptions, like one in 2015 that prompted authorities to evacuate thousands of people.","copyright":"The Villarrica volcano in Chile on September 2, 2018 (© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters)","copyrightonly":"© Cristobal Saavedra Escobar/Reuters","copyrightlink":"/search?q=villarrica+volcano&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190917_1400%22","date":"20190917","image":{"name":"OHR.Villarrica_EN-AU6279585693.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/92e179ede39751bafed5b7a9f5936ac57c50aadad784311c292b6d5f0a866170.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-AU6279585693_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Villarrica_EN-AU6279585693_tmb.jpg"}}
