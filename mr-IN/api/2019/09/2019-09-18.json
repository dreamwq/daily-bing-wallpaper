Although places like the Diu Fort or the Nagoa Beach are what are most frequently visited by tourists, the caves and quarries of Diu are a wonderful place to try some photography, simply because of the unusual play of light, like what you see on today’s homepage. A short walk from the main town, the Naida caves are well worth a visit. These are not natural caves; in fact they are abandoned Portuguese stone quarries.","copyright":"A quarry in Diu (© LEROY Francis/hemis.fr/Getty Images)","copyrightonly":"© LEROY Francis/hemis.fr/Getty Images","copyrightlink":"/search?q=diu+quarry&FORM=HPCAPT&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190918_1830%22","date":"20190918","image":{"name":"OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150.jpg","hd":"/image/e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.jpg","tmp":"/image/6d96c15f58e44192848e3230b988c11d40922c8cdb3464b774521d4087e234b7.jpg","binghd":"https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiuQuarry_EN-IN4863687150_tmb.jpg"}}
