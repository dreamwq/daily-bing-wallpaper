So, when this city celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival in 2018, a synchronized fleet of drones took to the skies over Shenzhen Talent Park and lit up in a globe shape to celebrate the holiday. What's the Mid-Autumn Festival? It’s a centuries-old harvest celebration observed by Chinese and Vietnamese populations. The date of the observance changes each year on our Gregorian calendar, falling on the first full moon of the harvest season, which arrives today. One major feature of the celebration? A sweet pastry called 'mooncake.' Let it be known that we fully embrace any holiday that includes cake.","copyright":"Drones light up the sky over Shenzhen, China (© Liang Weiming/VCG via Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=shenzhen+china&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220190912_1830%22","date":"20190912","image":{"name":"OHR.DroneGlobe_EN-IN0468265736.jpg","hd":"/images/073D6229B3676D896A966EDF4DAF4CDF769E70C391A4EE723942F8D614D58879.jpg","tmb":"/images/C8CE062EB0700AAB5BD4AEF38FC90EE1592A43B03222C15F4F42F4B40709F30B.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DroneGlobe_EN-IN0468265736_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DroneGlobe_EN-IN0468265736_tmb.jpg"}}
